Liverpool won the competition for only the second time, beating Newcastle United 3–0 in the final at Wembley, London. Matches were scheduled to be played at the stadium of the team named first on the date specified for each round, which was always a Saturday. Some matches, however, might be rescheduled for other days if there were clashes with games for other competitions or the weather was inclement.In this season matches were allowed to be played on Sundays for the first time. If scores were level after 90 minutes had been played, a replay would take place at the stadium of the second-named team later the same week. If the replayed match was drawn further replays would be held until a winner was determined. If scores were level after 90 minutes had been played in a replay, a 30-minute period of extra time would be played.   At this stage clubs from the Football League Third and Fourth Divisions joined those non-league clubs having come through the qualifying rounds. Matches were scheduled to be played on Saturday, 24 November 1973. Ten matches were drawn and went to replays. The matches were scheduled for Saturday, 15 December 1973. Five matches were drawn, with replays taking place later the same week. The 44 First and Second Division clubs entered the competition at this stage. The matches were scheduled for the weekend of 5–6 January 1974. Thirteen matches were drawn, of which one required a second replay. The matches were scheduled for Saturday, 26 January 1974. Four matches were, however, played the day after. Eight matches were drawn, of which one, the tie between Portsmouth and Leyton Orient, required a second replay. The matches were scheduled for Saturday, 16 February 1974 with one taking place the day after. Two matches were drawn and went to replays. The four quarter-final ties were played on 9 March 1974. The first Newcastle United–Nottingham Forest game was won 4–3 by Newcastle. However, early in the second half Nottingham Forest went 3–1 up from a penalty awarded by the referee, Gordon Kew. In awarding the penalty, a Newcastle player was sent off. The Newcastle United fans in the Leazes End of the ground (now the Sir John Hall stand) were renowned for their volatility, and invaded the pitch. Two Nottingham Forest players were injured in the debacle, but the referee waited until all players were recovered and received the permission of both managers to continue the tie before restarting it. Newcastle United managed to come back and win in spite of the two-goal and one-player deficit.[1] 23 people were taken to hospital as a result of the pitch invasion, of whom two had fractured skulls. 103 people received treatment at the ground and 39 were arrested.[2] Following the riot, a written protest was sent from Nottingham Forest to the FA on 11 March. In response, the secretary of the FA, Ted Croker, announced that a special four-man subcommittee of the Challenge Cup Committee who oversee the FA Cup competition were to investigate the incident with an eye to disqualifying Newcastle United, stating, \"Newcastle could be disqualified. We do not have the power to order a replay as the game was completed.\"[2] On 14 March the subcommittee ruled that, in spite of Mr. Croker\\'s comments, the match was to be replayed, at a neutral venue on Monday 18 March. If that match was drawn then extra time would be played and, if needed, a second match also at a neutral venue would be played the following Thursday. This decision was unprecedented at the time and the reaction was mixed, with Newcastle defender Frank Clark suggesting that Newcastle\\'s comeback from two goals down and with a player sent off should have allowed them to go through outright. The Nottingham Forest captain stated, \"we would have won it fair and square but for the trouble.\"[3] The first replay at Goodison Park was a nervous 0–0 draw and stayed so after extra time.[4] Newcastle finally won the tie through a single Macdonald goal in the second replay at Goodison Park.[5] The semi-final matches were played on Saturday, 30 March 1974 with the Liverpool–Leicester City game being replayed four days later. Liverpool and Newcastle United won their respective matches to go on to the final at Wembley. Liverpool v Leicester City Newcastle United v Burnley Leicester City v Liverpool Between 1970 and 1974, a third place playoff between the two losing semi-finalists was held.[6] Leicester City v Burnley The final took place on Saturday, 4 May 1974 at Wembley and ended in a victory for Liverpool over Newcastle United by three goals to nil. Two goals were scored by Kevin Keegan and one by Steve Heighway. The attendance was 100,000. Liverpool v Newcastle United The right to show FA Cup games were, as with Football League matches, shared between the BBC and ITV network. All games were shown in a highlights format, except the Final, which was shown live both on BBC1 & ITV. The BBC football highlights programme Match Of The Day would show up to three games and the various ITV regional network stations would cover up to one game and show highlights from other games covered elsewhere on the ITV network. No games from Rounds 1 or 2 were shown. Burnley banned TV Coverage of the Quarter-Final tie v Wrexham which was due to be shown on BBC MOTD, they showed a League game instead between Derby County v West Ham United as well as the Queens Park Rangers v Leicester Quarter-Final. Burnley and Chairman Bob Lord also tried to stop the Semi-Final being covered by ITV but couldn\\'t as the game was played at neutral Sheffield Wednesday.

In 1955, the team gained membership of the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU). Today the club is a feeder club for the Ospreys.[1] The club was founded in 1891, and they become known as the Aberavon Excel, playing in an all-white strip.[2] After the First World War in 1918, the Excels formed the Aberavon Harlequins R.F.C. which it has been known as since. They played on a waste site at what is now the Sandfields Estate, later renamed the Harlequins Field.[2] In 1932-33, the club was reformed by Dick Lody, Dill Stanford, Don Mainwaring and H.Williams, and the club grew until the start of Second World War. In 1951, the club received a boost when the former Maesteg RFC, Wales and British Lions scrum half Trevor Lloyd returned to Aberavon Harlequins, his original club.[2] The 1955/56 season was the best playing record in the Quins\\' history, playing over thirty matches and losing only once.[2] At the start of the 21st century, in an attempt to modernise the governing body of Welsh rugby union and to bring Wales fully into the professional era, it was decided to restructure the Welsh leagues and to source new sponsorship revenue for them. Teams would be allocated a division depending on their recent season’s order of merit and their geographical location. In the 2001/02 season, the Quins were placed in Lloyds TSB Division Two West, along with their local rivals Corus (Port Talbot) RFC. Note: Flags indicate national union as has been defined under WR eligibility rules. Players may hold more than one non-WR nationality.', 'Haddebyer Noor (Danish: Haddeby Nor) is a lake – formerly a small arm of the Schlei inlet of the Baltic Sea – in Schleswig-Holstein, Germany. At an elevation of 0 m, its surface area is 1\\xa0km². ', 'Wells-next-the-Sea Lifeboat Station is an RNLI operated lifeboat station located in the town of Wells-next-the-Sea in the English county of Norfolk.[2] The station operates both inshore and offshore lifeboats. The inshore boat is called Jane Ann III\\xa0(D-661)[3] and is a D-class (IB1) lifeboat, whilst the offshore boat is called Doris M, Mann of Ampthill\\xa0(ON 1161),[4] and is a Mersey class lifeboat. The station boathouse is located at the beach on the western side of Wells Harbour mouth.[5]   The earliest attempts at rescue at sea in the Wells area were performed by the Beachmen[6] or Longshoremen who formed their own Beachmen’s company at Wells,[7] and used a fast sailing yawl to rescue and salvage distressed vessels along this part of the coast. However this was done to the benefit of both parties.[6] On reaching a distressed vessel, the beachmen could claim right of salvage and with this in mind there would be a negotiation were terms of employment were settled with the beachmen often driving home a hard bargain.[6] The beachmen’s work was arduous and fraught with danger, and on many occasions they earned nothing at all. The first organised rescue service at Wells was run by the Norfolk Shipwreck Association and began in 1830[5] when an existing lifeboat that had been at Cromer was sent to Wells. The boat had no name but was of the Greathead or North Country non self-righter type. It was a pulling lifeboat and was powered with ten oars. By the 1860s the lifeboat operation run by the Norfolk Shipwreck Association had fallen into a rapid decline with no lifeboat stationed at Wells, whilst at this same time there was a marked increase in the number of maritime incidents of the shores of North Norfolk. In 1868 the newly formed RNLI was approached by the local townsfolk to see if they would re-organise the lifeboat service in the town. The RNLI sent an inspector to the town and he reported back to the institutes Committee of Management recommending the setting up of an organised lifeboat service in the town. The RNLI agreed with his findings and put plans into action. A new self-righting lifeboat of the latest design was ordered for the town. To accommodate the new lifeboat the construction of a substantial new boathouse[8] was begun. The new station was on the quay close to the town. The building was opened in 1869, along with the new lifeboat. The lifeboat was a 33-foot self-righting type and was called RNLB\\xa0Eliza Adams.[9] This lifeboat house was used until 1895 when the service was re-located at the far end of Beach Road. The Grade II[10] listed building still stands and is used jointly as the harbour Masters Office and a Maritime Museum. In the latter part of the 1800s it was becoming clear to the local lifeboatmen that there station was not in the most useful location and was more than a mile from the open sea. The problem was highlighted in 1893 when the lifeboat RNLB\\xa0Baltic\\xa0(ON 198)[9][11] was launched to service on three occasions and failed to effect any rescues. The collier Duke of Cornwall was wrecked east of Wells, fortunately without loss of life. In the same day the barge Lord Beresford was driven ashore at Holkham beach with her crew rescued from the rigging without any help from the lifeboat. The third failure occurred two days later when the schooner Hickman went ashore at Wells Bar. Most of the crew were eventually rescued but two of the crew died of exposure after taking to the rigging. The struggling lifeboat was beached and two of her crew were washed overboard but were rescued. The problem was that at low water the lifeboat could not get out into the open sea and relied on the rise and fall of the tide to much. Even with a favourable tide if the wind was against the lifeboat it effectively was trapped in the Harbour. To remedy the location problem the RNLI acquired some land 1.2 miles (1.9\\xa0km) north of the existing station on the western point overlooking the harbour mouth. Work began on the new station in 1894 but due to delays the station was not ready until October 1895. The previouse problems had also highlighted the Baltic’s shortfalls and the station was supplied with a more efficient lifeboat. The new lifeboat was of a type which the Wells crew had a preference for. The new boat was a Cromer Self-righting type built by Beeching Bros of Great Yarmouth.[12] The new lifeboat arrived on station in July 1895 and she was called RNLB\\xa0Baltic\\xa0(ON 375)[9][11] and was a pulling lifeboat with 14 oars. Whilst on the station she was launched to service a total of 13 times and she is credited with saving 19 lives.[9] Although the RNLI had been considering the idea of providing Wells with a motor lifeboat since 1911, it was not until July 1936 that the station was provided with one. This was because of the launching situation at Wells and the need for carriage launched motor lifeboat to be designed. The Surf-class lifeboat[13] was designed by James Barnett and was light enough for the beach launch required at Wells. RNLB\\xa0Royal Silver Jubilee\\xa0(ON 780) was also the first Surf-class to be propelled by Hotchkiss Cone[13] propulsion system which was a basic water jet system. This system of propulsion was ideal for conditions at Wells, where the water is very shallow at times and combined with her comparative lightness and shallow draught made her ideal for when the tide is fully out, and the lifeboat required to be taken out several miles to be launched. By the mid 1960s this area of the North Norfolk coast had seen an increase of pleasure craft and beach leisure activities. The RNLI saw a change in the pattern of casualties with an increasing number of services required to rescue bathers washed out to sea, people on lilos, dinghies, and various small water craft. It was realised locally that a faster first response was needed to attend such situations and to relieve the Wells all weather lifeboat RNLB\\xa0Cecil Paine\\xa0(ON 850) from the inshore workload. In 1963 the inshore service was established and a small boathouse was erected adjacent to the west of the main boat hall at Beach Road. The first inshore boat was a D-class (IB1) with the operation number D-11 which served for the first year of the inshore operations. This boat was followed by a succession of D-class boats. The first to have a name was Spirit of Rotary\\xa0(D-246), and she was on the station from 1976 until 1987. In January 1978 a severe storm destroyed the IRB house and damaged the doors to the main boathall. A new IRB house was built onto the side of the main station. The beach road station, over the years, has been improved and renovated on several occasions, to keep the facilities at their optimal state of purpose. Much of the stations original 1895[5] structure is the major integral part of the building. The crew facilities were expanded in 1983[5] by building a first floor above the ILB house previously added to the side of the station. A boathouse extension was added on to the back of the station in 1986.[5] This improvement was necessary to house the inshore lifeboat. The new Talus MB-H T99 tractor[14] which was supplied to improve the launch equipment for the lifeboats was then housed in the old inshore lifeboat house, which also had to be enlarged and altered. In 1990 the station was allocated a new Mersey-class lifeboat. She was called Doris M. Mann of Ampthill[9][15] and she became operational on 3 July of that year. To accommodate this new lifeboat the station once again had to be considerably enlarged and altered. The house had to be almost completely re-built whilst still retaining the historic integrity of the 1895 station. In the mid 1990s work was also carried out to the outside environment of the station. Work was carried out on the timber revetments and groynes to prevent further coastal erosion of the sandy headland on which the boat house is located. This was achieved by re-using the Greenheart[9] timbers re-claimed after the demolishion of the Eastbourne[9] slipway. Extra new groynes were also installed to retain the beach in front of the station, vital for the continued beach launching of the lifeboats. With the Wells station barely large enough to house the lifeboats and all their necessary equipment, space is at a premium. Unfortunately the station has no separate public area or viewing gallery, but is still open for public visitation. The situation gives the visitor a different, and up close experience with the station but with the necessity for extra care to be taken when moving around the open areas. There is a gift shop and information area but this has limited open hours in the summer and when there are specific events and visits are organised. In 1979[9] the station became the subject of an iconic photograph. The photograph named The Rescue Team[16] was taken by Campbell MacCallum.[17] The photo was conceived as a poster project just for display in the crew room of the station. The composition of the photograph included the Oakley-class motor lifeboat RNLB\\xa0Ernest Tom Nethercoat\\xa0(ON 982),[9] The inshore lifeboat, the lifeboat crews, officials, supporters, fund-raisers and the local coastguards. The RNLI Headquarters in Poole were given a copy of the photograph and were very impressed. The RNLI requested that they might use the poster to distributor to all its stations and to use as a fund raiser.[9] The photograph was renamed Portrait of a Lifeboat Station and was distributed to all RNLI stations, branches, guilds, Armed Forces, Educational authorities, and many other organisations worldwide. The poster was even sighting on the wall of a 24hr Tailor in downtown Hong Kong.[16] In 1986 the same format was used to produce another poster but this time using the Hastings lifeboat. Wells was chosen in again in 1993 and again in 2000 for the \"Millennium Rescue Team\" poster.[9] On 29 October 1880, gales were lashing the north coast of Norfolk. The 171 ton Ocean Queen, of Sunderland was on passage from Southampton to Seaham when she was caught in the storm and sought shelter at Wells-next-the-Sea. At 1:00pm, the Wells lifeboat RNLB\\xa0Eliza Adams launched to the aid of another brig, the Sharon Rose, which had run ashore on the beach at nearby Holkham. Seven sailors were rescued from the vessel and the lifeboat returned safely to Wells. However, on arrival back to the quay, the Ocean Queen was seen close to the harbour entrance, flying a distress flag. After changing 8 of her 13 crew, the Eliza Adams was again towed to sea. By this stage the Ocean Queen had been driven ashore on the nearby sands. The lifeboat reached the brig, but was unable to help and so set sail to return to port. In so doing, a heavy wave broke over the lifeboat and it capsized. The crew of the Ocean Queen remained aboard their vessel, and were able to walk ashore once the storm had abated and the tide receded. Eleven of the 13 crew drowned, leaving 10 widows and 27 children without a father. One crew member, William Bell, managed to stay with the boat until it righted itself. Another, Thomas Kew, was washed ashore alive. A memorial to the members of the Wells lifeboat crew who lost their lives stands adjacent to the old lifeboat house. On 4 October 1883[18] the coastline of Wells-next-the-Sea was being lashed by a heavy north-easterly gale. The lifeboat RNLB\\xa0Charlotte Nicholls was launched to service in heavy seas. The schooner Emma of Jersey had been blown onto the East Bar and had become stranded.[18] With coxswain Horace Hinson at the helm, the lifeboat arrived to find the schooner’s sails torn, her bulwarks washed away and the heavy sea crashing over the deck. There were five crew aboard of which one was a boy and all were tired and suffering from hypothermia.[18] The lifeboat took all five aboard and landed them safely back at Wells. Over 18 and 19 May 1963 [19] the cabin cruiser Seamu of Frinton had run aground at low tide at the entrance to Blakeney harbour. The Wells lifeboat RNLB\\xa0Cecil Paine\\xa0(ON 850) was launched to service with coxswain Francis Taylor at the helm. The lifeboat arrived at the scene at 10.50 pm, the sea was rough and a strong west-north-west breeze was continuing. Coxswain Taylor made an approach to the stricken vessel but progress was halted by a sandbank. He then started further attempts to approach and by now the wind had strengthened to a near gale force. After four approaches the lifeboat finally got alongside and the lifeboatmen dragged the two crew from the cruiser aboard the lifeboat and to safety. The lifeboat was back at the Wells Station by 3.15 am. For his part in the rescue coxswain Taylor was awarded a Bronze medal. On the morning of 15 February 1979[5] the weather was atrocious with a gale force nine to storm force ten blowing blizzard conditions across the north sea.[5] In these freezing conditions the Wells lifeboat Ernest Tom Neathercoat was launched to service[5] that morning. The Merchant Vessel Savinesti of Romania had broken down and was dragging her anchor and was in imminent danger of running aground 37 miles (60\\xa0km) south-west of Spurn Point. The lifeboat struggled to make headway through huge seas and temperatures well below freezing. The Ernest Tom Neathercoat had lost her radar, MF radio and echo-sounder,[5] all knocked out by the continuous battering of the seas. Overcoming these difficulties, she eventually arrived at the scene and she stood by the Savinesti until the expected arrival of the Humber Arun-class lifeboat RNLB\\xa0City of Bradford IV\\xa0(ON 1052),[20] which was to take over the service. The Humber lifeboat had slipped her moorings at 11.24am that same morning. The Wells lifeboat stood by the Savinesti for over two hours before the larger Humber lifeboat arrived. The lifeboat crew during this wait had been up to their waist in seawater in the open exposed Oakley lifeboat.[21] The storm had also increased from gale force eleven to hurricane force twelve. The waves had been up to 40 feet high and it was continuous heavy snow. By the time the Humber lifeboat was close by the Wells lifeboat had been joined at the scene the coastal tanker Annuity and the North Sea ferry Norwave[22] which flanked the Savinesti. At this time the Wells lifeboat was released from the service and sent on her way back home with the intention of using what was left of the daylight to get back to Wells. In terrible conditions the tired, cold crew and their boat got back to Wells between six and seven pm. In what he described as The worst trip I’ve ever had[21] coxswain David Cox was awarded an RNLI silver medal.[23] The rest of the crew, two of whom had suffered frostbite[24] during the eleven hours at sea, were awarded service certificates.', 'Sporting Yankee (foaled 31 January 1974) was an American-bred, British-trained Thoroughbred racehorse. He showed great promise as a two-year-old in 1976 when he won two of his three races including the Group One William Hill Futurity. In the following year he ran poorly when strongly-fancied for the 2000 Guineas but won the March Stakes and finished second in both the Craven Stakes and the Geoffrey Freer Stakes. He failed to win in four races in 1978 and was retired from racing to become a breeding stallion in Brazil.   Sporting Yankee was a \"tall\"[2] bay horse with a white blaze and a white sock on his right foreleg bred in Kentucky by Nelson Bunker Hunt. His sire, Vaguely Noble, won the Prix de l\\'Arc de Triomphe in 1968 before becoming a successful breeding stallion whose best progeny included Dahlia, Exceller and Empery.[3] Sporting Yankee\\'s dam Sale Day was a top-class racemare who won the Spinster Stakes in 1968 and produced several other winners including the Yellow Ribbon Stakes winner Amazer. She was also a sister of Hurry to Market the American Champion Two-Year-Old Male Horse of 1963.[4] As a yearling Sporting Yankee was offered for sale and auctioned for $90,000 by representatives of the British bookmaking firm William Hill Racing. He was sent to race in England where he was trained at Lambourn by Peter Walwyn. Until 1975, British racehorses did not allow horse names which advertised companies: the relaxation of the rules allowed the colt to be named to promote the Yankee, a popular four-horse combination bet offered by UK bookmakers.[5] Sporting Yankee began his racing career in a seven furlong maiden race at Newmarket Racecourse in early October in which he overcame an unfavourable draw to finish second to Sin Timon, a colt who went on to win the Cambridgeshire Handicap in 1977. In the Chesterton Maiden Stakes over the same course and distance two weeks later he drew away from his twenty-six opponents in the last quarter mile to win by four lengths.[5] At the end of October, the colt was moved up sharply in class for the William Hill Futurity over one mile at Doncaster Racecourse. The race had previously been known as the Timeform Gold Cup and the Observer Gold Cup before Sporting Yankee\\'s owner took over the sponsorship in 1976. Ridden by Pat Eddery and racing on very soft ground he started at odds of 9/2[6] against five opponents headed by the Vincent O\\'Brien-trained Valinsky who was made the odds on favourite after winning his only previous start in Ireland by five lengths. The other four runners were Orchestra (winner of the Beresford Stakes), Juge de Paix (runner-up in the Prix La Rochette) and the 66/1 outsiders Sultan\\'s Ruby and Atwood. Sporting Yankee took an early lead, then settled into second behind Sultan\\'s Roby before moving back to the front at half way. He stayed on strongly in the straight to win by two lengths from Sultan\\'s Ruby with a gap of four lengths back to Orchestra in third.[5] On his three-year-old debut Sporting Yankee contested the Craven Stakes (a major trial race for the 2000 Guineas) over one mile at Newmarket in April. He was beaten a head by the Guy Harwood-trained Limone, to whom he was conceding ten pounds.[7] In the 2000 Guineas over the same course and distance he started joint-second favourite behind The Minstrel, but finished unplaced in a race won by Nebbiolo. He was then moved up in distance for the Predominate Stakes over a mile and a half at Goodwood Racecourse in May and finished fourth behind Royal Blend.[2] After a break of almost three months, Sporting Yankee returned in the Geoffrey Freer Stakes at Newbury Racecourse in August in which he was matched against older horses for the first time. He was beaten two lengths into second by Valinsky with the four-year-old Norfolk Air in third place. Later in the month he faced only two opponents in the March Stakes over one and three quarter miles at Goodwood and recorded his only success of the year, beating the Barry Hills-trained Crown Bowler by four lengths. On his final appearance of the season the colt was sent to France for the Prix Royal Oak over 3100 metres at Longchamp Racecourse in which he started a 28/1 outsider and finished tenth of the thirteen runners behind Rex Magna.[2] Sporting Yankee remained in training as a four-year-old but failed to recover his best form. He finished third to Orchestra in the John Porter Stakes on his seasonal debut but ran unplaced in three subsequent races and was retired at the end of the season.[8] There was no International Classification of European two-year-olds in 1976: the official handicappers of Britain, Ireland, and France compiled separate rankings for horses which competed in those countries. In the British Free Handicap, Sporting Yankee was given top-weight of 116 pounds, seventeen pounds behind the top-rated J O Tobin. The independent Timeform organisation were more impressed, giving him a rating of 123, making him seven pounds inferior to J O Tobin and eight behind the French champion Blushing Groom. In their annual Racehorses of 1976 Timeform described him as a \"rather weak and gangling\" juvenile who was likely to improve as he matured.[5] Timeform gave him a rating of 117 in 1977[2] and 100 in 1978.[8] After his retirement from racing, Sporting Yankee was exported to Brazil to become a breeding stallion.[8] His last recorded foals were born in 1985.', \"The River Company was a rock band based out of Ocean Springs, Mississippi.

After many years of recording with at his younger brothers home studio, he finally got his long waited record deal. He became an Iranian pop-sensation with the single \"Baron\". Iman has lived many years in both Denmark and Norway, but currently resides in Munich, Germany.   Iman\\'s massive interest in music became clear in the early stages of his childhood. When he was five years old, he was caught while sneaking himself into the garage in the middle of the night to play with his father\\'s saxophone. After catching him, his father was amused with the fact that his son had taken such great interest in music from such a young age. Being proud of his initiative, his parents bought him a piano for his sixth birthday. Coming from a family of musicians, Iman also started singing shortly after he\\'s knowledge with the piano evolved. He\\'s father, Ebi Ebrahimi used to play the saxophone in a locally-famous band during his high school and college years. His mother, Fariba Vakili, though not particularly good with any instrument, was known by her friends and family for her beautiful voice. Both parents used to sing at home, when they were at family parties or in other public events, something that also Iman started to inherit and get comfortable with. At the age of 13, attending his father\\'s cousins wedding, Iman was asked to step on stage to play the piano and sing a song. Everyone fell in love with the amazing talent and voice control that the young man had. In an interview with TV Persia, Iman said that this was the moment in his life when he realized that he actually could make it in the music industry. he is proudser for mohsen yeganeh , ehsan khaje amiri ,mohsen chavoshi ,...... At the age of 15, he immigrated to Denmark along with his mother and little brother Omid Ebrahimi. At the immigration center, he got quickly known for his unique voice, as he was often asked to perform in Persian cultural events. Once he turned 18, he was asked by the Danish government to apply for asylum separate from his family, something that was very uncommon since he immigrated to Denmark when he was under 18 (at the age of 15) and was already in a family application with his mother and brother. Coming here with his family, Iman had no idea what to apply for separately, since he was brought to Denmark by his mom for family reasons, not personal reasons. After all he was just a teenager. It ended in a denial of his separate asylum application, which resulted in that the Danish government was going to send him back to Iran, something Iman clearly did not want. Therefore he moved to Norway all alone, at the age of 18, to seek asylum. Two years later, he\\'s family application in Denmark also got denied, which also made his mother and brother move to Norway to seek asylum. His brother, Omid Ebrahimi, who had just turned 12 at the time, also had a great interest in music. Omid started experimenting, at a relatively early age, with music editing programs and components. He was especially interested in the concept of mixing and editing. This was the musical turning point for both brothers. A few years later, when his brother Omid Ebrahimi turned 15, Omid received a professional recording microphone as a gift from his mom. This took Omid\\'s editing skills to the next level, and resulted in that Iman started recording with his younger brother. With limited resources, in other words only a microphone, and a few barely functional components, Iman started to do some amateur recording in his brother\\'s room. Over the years, they spent time, money and other resources to turn Omid\\'s room into a decent home studio, something that turned out to benefit Iman greatly over the upcoming years. By the age of 24, when his brother was 17, they had managed to create a few professional songs. A year later, Iman tells TV Persia that his younger brother Omid, sent a few songs to two well known music studios nearby their home in order to get them to sign Iman. One of the studios, while amused by the fact that a foreign singer wanted to record in a Norwegian studio, something that they found quite weird, did not want to take the risk to record music in a language that they clearly did not even understand. However, positive news came back from the other studio. The producer there, though not understanding a word of what Iman was singing about, knew there was something special and unique about Iman\\'s voice, and decided to sign him despite the risks of it being hard to find a marked for Persian music outside of Iran. A year later, at the age of 26, Iman became an Iranian pop-sensation with the song \"Baron\", which instantly climbed its way up on the Iranian top lists. With Iran\\'s strict regime, his music (just as any other artist outside of Iran) became illegal in Iran, because of its \"Western form\"[4] and content about love and freedom. However this did not spread the quick spread of his music through the Iranian underground, which made him gain hundreds of thousands of fans in a short time. Over the years it has become very difficult, not only for Iman, but for all Persian artists to spread their new songs, specially over the Internet since the Iranian regime has blocked sites such as YouTube, Facebook, Twitter etc.[5] There are however ways for the people inside Iran to visit sites such as Myspace and Backupflow, where Iman\\'s songs have gained huge popularity. With over 200 000 plays on Myspace alone,[6] Iman has made a name for himself during the short time he has entered the music industry. Iman recently[when?] released his first album \"Hasrat\", that include his two new hit songs \"Be Yade To\"[7] and \"Az Hame Del Boridam\".[8] His brother, Omid Ebrahimi is the executive producer of the second song, \"Az Hame Del Boridam\".

Nothing is known about the life of Metrodorus. The time he lived is not certain: he may have lived as early as the 3rd century AD, but it is more likely that he lived in the time of the emperors Anastasius I and Justin I, in the early 6th century.[1] His name occurs in connection with 45 mathematical epigrams which are to be found in book 14 of the Greek Anthology.[2] Although he may have authored some of the epigrams, it is generally accepted that he collected most of them, and some of them may predate the 5th century BC.[1] Many of the epigrams lead to simple equations, and they are of the same type as those found in the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus (17th century BC).[3] Among the problems Metrodorus collected are:[3]', 'License to Kill (German:\"Lizenz zum Töten:Wie Israel seine Feinde liquidiert\") is a 2013 German documentary film about Israel directed by Egmont R.

The team, which plays in the Eastern League, is the Double-A affiliate of the New York Mets major-league club. The Rumble Ponies play in NYSEG Stadium, located in Binghamton.   Prior to moving to Binghamton for 1992 as the Binghamton Mets, this franchise played in Williamsport, Pennsylvania, from 1987 to 1991 as the Williamsport Bills. The team was an affiliate of the Cleveland Indians in 1987 and 1988, and was affiliated with the Seattle Mariners during the 1989 and 1990 seasons before being purchased by the New York Mets in 1991. The Bills franchise was actually two separate franchises. After the 1988 season, the original owners moved the Bills to Hagerstown, Maryland, while the Eastern League franchise based in Pittsfield, Massachusetts, moved back to Williamsport before the 1989 season. It was the latest in a long series of moves for the Pittsfield franchise, which was originally based in Williamsport in 1976 and later moved to Jersey City, New Jersey, from 1977 through 1978 and then Buffalo, New York, from 1979 through 1984. In 2016 the current franchise announced a plan to change the team\\'s name effective for the 2017 season and confirmed that it was committed to staying in Binghamton for the foreseeable future.[2] The team held a name-the-team contest on its website from May 17 to June 1 of 2016; the finalists were the Bullheads (for the bullhead catfish abundant in the nearby Susquehanna River), Gobblers (for the rich hunting culture of the area, as well as the turkeys in Binghamton), Rocking Horses (for the Triple Cities\\' nickname as the \"Carousel Capital of The World\"), Rumble Ponies (also a carousel tribute), Stud Muffins (for the collections of carousel horses in Binghamton), and Timber Jockeys (for everyone who rides the carousels).[3][4] On November 3, 2016, the team announced that it would be rebranding as the Binghamton Rumble Ponies, and released a new logo.

The company was shortly renamed Actrix Computer Corp after trademark disputes, and the name of the computer line was changed to Actrix   The Access Computer had dual 5.25-inch floppy drives (either 320k-DS or 168k-SS) a detachable keyboard, a 7\" built-in amber CRT monitor, and a built-in 80 CPS Epson MX80 dot matrix printer with GRAFTRAX-80 chipset. It used the CP/M operating system, and also included a Bell-103 300baud modem with both acoustic-coupled and direct connections. Additional connectors for IEEE-488 (external hard disk), composite monitor, RS2-32 serial and Centronics parallel were provided. The mainboard has a 50-pin header designed to support 8-inch disk drives (4 heads on two double-sided disks - drive letters C:/D: and E:/F:) Access Matrix came bundled with MBASIC, CBASIC, the Perfect-series office software, Personal Pearl database and Fancy Font markup/formatting system. Custom-written software included a disk format/verify/duplication utility (DISKU.COM) that worked with both the internal A:/B: drives as well as optional external 8\" disks (C:/D: and E:/F:). A custom-written Telecommunications utility (TELCOMU.COM) offered dialup address book, basic terminal emulation, XMODEM/Modem7 file transfer and other features for connection to BBS and other online systems or to operate as a drone to receive files uploaded from other computers. Although not truly portable the all-in-one design did allow for quick setup and shut-down. It was rugged and although weighing 15\\xa0kg, it was reasonably easy to transport in a car or in an aircraft\\'s coat- locker. The Access Matrix had option of a padded cloth bag with shoulder-strap or a heavier-duty leather/cloth bound protective case with carry handle and shoulder-strap. Apparently the system was popular with journalists who could use the inbuilt \"OFFLINE\" type-writer mode to create and print simple ad hoc single-page documents ready for immediate faxing to HQ from their hotel lobby. Another option was to combine the word processing and telecommunications features to create a document using the word processing software and immediately upload the document directly to either an online services such as Compuserve or indeed to another \\'waiting\\' Access Matrix at their head office. The rebadged Actrix DS was presented at the Las Vegas Comdex in November 1983. There was another model called the Actrix SS with a 170k 5.25-inch disk drive.', 'George Martin Lamb (born 20 December 1979) is an English radio and television presenter, currently presenting Football Tonight on BT Sport. In 2012, Lamb presented the Channel 4 game show The Bank Job. He is the son of actor Larry Lamb.   Born in Hammersmith, West London,[1][2] Lamb was educated at St Christopher School, a boarding independent school in Letchworth Garden City, Hertfordshire. Lamb\\'s radio career peaked with presenting an eponymous daytime BBC Radio 6 Music show, for two years from October 2007 to November 2009,[3] before being moved the early weekend mornings for 6 months, then leaving 6 Music in May 2010.[4] His show mixed shock jock banter with his Ministry of Sound DJ co-host, Marc Hughes;[5] Jamaican Patois, dancehall music and loud foghorns. Lamb\\'s last known radio work was a 2010 Starbucks-sponsored Spotify slot[6] and a brief stint at TalkSport.[citation needed] Lamb\\'s television career started in 2007 when he replaced Alex Zane as the host of the second series of BBC reality show Celebrity Scissorhands and returned in 2008 for the third series. He has also presented The Restaurant, Road To V and Young Butcher of the Year, as parodied on Harry Hill\\'s TV Burp, and also parodied by Ray Peacock and Ed Gamble on The Peacock and Gamble Podcast.[7] Lamb was the presenter of Big Brother\\'s Little Brother (or BBLB) from mid-2008, taking over from Dermot O\\'Leary who had presented BBLB since 2001. He first presented the show with co-host Zezi Ifore, though she was sacked halfway through the series, leaving Lamb the sole presenter. For the final series of BBLB in 2010, Emma Willis joined Lamb as co-presenter. Willis moved with Big Brother to Channel 5 when the rights were bought from Channel 4, however Lamb did not. On 19 February 2010, he presented EastEnders Live: The Aftermath alongside Kirsten O\\'Brien, interviewing the cast and production team after the first live episode of EastEnders. He took part in a reality TV show on ITV2 called The Parent Trip with his father, actor Larry Lamb. On 31 March 2011, he appeared in an episode of Celebrity Juice with his dad.

In March 2010, he supported Global Cool by going on a flight-free holiday to Barcelona with his friend and fellow TV presenter Rick Edwards.[16] Lamb\\'s former 6 Music show proved controversial, being atypical of 6 Music\\xa0– for example, its shock jock style encroached upon youth-oriented BBC Radio 1\\'s daytime public service remit. It marked a significant diversion from 6 Music\\'s principally novel, trans-era eclectic-musicologistic origins and tradition. This gambit proved controversial, driving an attrition of 6 Music\\'s long time listeners, provoking rival petitioning websites: anti- GetLambOut.org.UK[17] and pro- KeepLambIn.co.UK.[18] Similarly, national media reviews were polarised[19][20] Radio veteran Paul Gambaccini said Lamb\\'s interview with Ray Davies of The Kinks was \"worst interview in the history of broadcasting\".[21] In May 2008 Lamb was reprimanded for pledging his support on air for Boris Johnson in the London mayoral race.[22] In 2014, he criticised the BBC, claiming \"You can\\'t have opinions at the Beeb\".[23]', 'Bagh-e Mir (Persian: باغ مير\\u200e\\u200e, also Romanized as Bāgh-e Mīr)[1] is a village in Khabar Rural District, in the Central District of Baft County, Kerman Province, Iran.

He lost his father at an early age. In 1894, he studied at two-year Russo-Tatar school in his native village with the help of his mother, but he could not finish his education because of material problems. In 1902, he worked in a ground area, which he inherited from his father. The February Revolution of 1907 had a significant influence on the formation of Shadlinski’s political thinking. In 1918 and 1919 he commanded the self-defence forces of Vedi.[4] against Dashnak detachments. In autumn 1920, the \"Red camp\" partisan detachment, of which Shadlinski became the commander, and was distinguished during Civil War in Nakhchivan, was formed on the initiative of Nakhchivan communists. Initially the detachment consisted of 200 Azerbaijani soldiers, but later it filled with new forces of other nationalities. It is noted that Turkish command authority repeatedly wanted to bring Abbasgulu bey and his friend Huseynov to trial. Atik Azizyan, leader of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of Armenia, writing about the reasons for Abbasgulu bey and his friend Huseynov’s pursuit, noted, \"The point is that these people foil plans of the Turkish Commanding Authority with their activity.\" Later he wrote that \"Abbasgulu bey rendered the Soviet Authority great services\" when the Soviet authority was established in Nakhchivan and that is why Abbasgulu bey aroused hatred of Turks...\"[5] Shadlinski, commander of the \"Red Camp\" detachment was conferred the Order of the Red Banner for his merits, which he showed in battles against the Dashnak authority. There were also 18 Azerbaijanis, including such commanders of companies as Ibrahim Farzaliyev, Alakbar Sadykhov, Museyib Akhundov, Fatulla Huseynov, Gafar Aliyev, Ibrahim Asgerov and Khalil Mehdiyev among the awarded ones.[6] Shadlinski stayed in Nakhchivan till the end of 1922, and led a guard of state borders. From 1922 to 1928, after he returned to Vedi, he worked in several industrial positions of the Armenian SSR, and later was appointed to the chairman of a cement mill in Davalu village. He was killed by unknown person in 1930.[7] Abbas gulu Gulu bey Shadlinski’s image was shown in Farman Karimzade’s Snowy pass novel. In 1971, Azerbaijanfilm film studio shot the Snowy pass film based on motifs of the novel. Hasan Mammadov played the role of Shadlinski.[citation needed]', \"The TV Now Awards (known presently for sponsorship reasons as the Walkers Sensations TV Now Awards) is an annual awards ceremony which takes place in Ireland.

Lena is located at latitude 32.7535025ºN and longitude 81.2151029ºW, at an altitude of 108\\xa0feet (33\\xa0m).[3] Lena\\'s history has largely been intertwined with the Southern Railroad (today\\'s Norfolk Southern). From 1899 until the 1980s, Southern operated a line through Lena and nearby Allendale, Tarboro, and Furman. Called the \"Southern Columbia to Savannah Route\", the rail also ran through Barnwell and Blackville to the North. Its primary purpose for Southern was to increase north/south passenger/freight traffic by feeding into ACL (Atlantic Coast Line) at Hardeeville for passage south to Florida or north to Charleston and other points. The rail line was built to compete with another North/South rail line operated nearby by Seaboard Air Line (also called the Florida Central & Peninsular, later Seaboard Coast Line, and presently CSX) which ran a different course through Denmark, Fairfax, Estill, Garnett (parallel to U.S. Route 321) and then into Georgia. Between 1963 and 1970, Southern abandoned its tracks between Furman and Hardeeville leaving Furman as the ending station from Columbia.[4] Finally, in the early 1980s, Southern abandoned its tracks south of Blackville, ending rail service to Barnwell, Allendale, Lena, and Furman. However, by the 1970s, any rail service to Furman (through Lena) would have been a rare event.[5] Nearby Estill was founded at about the same time as Lena. Estill was named after the president of the Seaboard Air Line Railroad which laid tracks through what is now Estill at about the same time Southern was laying tracks through what is today\\'s Lena. Lena was named for Aline Lawton, whose father, W.A. Lawton, owned land Southern workers camped on.

Bobbye Jean Hall was born in Detroit, Michigan, and began her career there playing percussion in nightclubs while still in her teens. Using bongos, congas and other percussion, she played uncredited on many Motown recordings.[1] She lived in Europe for a few years during which time she changed the spelling of her name from Bobby to Bobbye, to distinguish herself as a woman and as a unique musician.[2] She moved to Los Angeles in 1970 where she was one of the few female session musicians in a male-dominated profession, a sometime associate of the Funk Brothers.[3][4] Already a veteran player by May 1971, she added her bongo skills to Marvin Gaye\\'s \"Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler)\".[5] Her first studio gig behind a full rock drum kit was with Chris Ethridge on his album L.A. Getaway—Ethridge said \"she was great\".[6] Hall recorded several albums with Bill Withers, including his No. 1 hit \"Lean On Me\", and an album recorded live at Carnegie Hall. She toured with Carole King in May–June 1973 after having participated on two of King\\'s studio albums.[7] During this tour Hall asked King to stop introducing her as \"Little Bobbye from Detroit\". King suggested \"Ms. Bobbye Hall\" and from that time forward, Hall was known as Ms. Bobbye Hall.[2] In May 1974, she performed again at Carnegie Hall, this time backing James Taylor, a follow-up to appearing on two of his albums. Stevie Wonder used Hall\\'s percussion skills for a few songs in 1974 and 1976, including \"Bird of Beauty\" where her artful quica work established a mood of Brazil at Carnival.[8] In 1973–1974, Hall began to be credited sometimes as Bobbye Hall Porter, also Bobbye Porter Hall, after her marriage to record producer Joe Porter.[9][10][11] Hall released one album of her own in March 1977: Body Language For Lovers, a soul-jazz instrumental work featuring tunes co-written by her and her husband. Billboard recommended the LP,[12] but it did not chart. In 1978, Bob Dylan took her on a world tour, from mid-February to mid-December, paying her $2,500 per week—about $9,200 in today\\'s dollars.[13] This handsome compensation was arranged to pay for the studio sessions she would be missing.[13] The men and women appearing on stage with Dylan were required to wear costumes designed in Hollywood by Bill \"Spoony\" Whitten, and the musicians did not like them. Lead guitarist Billy Cross said \"the band looked like a large aggregation of pimps\", and backup singer Debi Dye-Gibson said she and the other women \"looked like hookers\".[13] The show\\'s playlist was a collection of Dylan\\'s greatest hits, as specified by promoters at the tour\\'s Japanese stops. All the songs, even the sparse acoustic ones, were arranged for a full band and a big sound. Hall and the musicians stayed at the best hotels side-by-side with Dylan, and flew on a chartered jet airliner which held suites and a bar. Hall joined Dylan from time to time at dinner, and was surprised to find him a longtime fan of soul food—she observed him to be \"infatuated by going out with black women\\xa0...by that whole black thing, [even] eating the food.\"[13] He entertained her with card tricks.[13] However, the tour began to wear on him, and he called band meetings where he criticized his musicians sharply for being too formulaic. Hall remarked of these encounters, \"when he spoke to us, he was not the poet.\"[13] A two-disc album was produced using 22 songs recorded live in Japan: Bob Dylan at Budokan, and a stop in Santa Monica, California, allowed Dylan and most of the touring band to cut a studio album, Street-Legal, with Hall on percussion.[14] In late August 1978, in between Dylan tour dates, Hall played congas for Tom Waits\\'s Blue Valentine album, on the track \"Romeo Is Bleeding\", giving it a gritty Latin feel.[15] In 1979, she recorded The Wall with Pink Floyd. She recorded with Bob Seger\\'s Silver Bullet Band in the early 1980s. Hall joined Stevie Nicks for her album Bella Donna and toured with her in 1982 and 1986.[16] For the 1986 film Little Shop of Horrors, Hall played tambourine and congas on the soundtrack.[17] Other musicians she has recorded for include Fanny, Kim Carnes, Lynyrd Skynyrd, Janis Joplin, Tavares, Randy Newman, Rod Stewart, Dolly Parton, Mel Brown, Leo Sayer, Cecilio & Kapono, Russ Ballard, Donovan, Joni Mitchell, Jerry Garcia, Patti Scialfa, Freda Payne, Dwight Yoakam, Donald Byrd, Gene Harris, Bobby Hutcherson, Grant Green, Ferron, Poco, the Temptations, Mary Wells, Jefferson Starship, Kenny Rankin, the Manhattan Transfer, Stanley Turrentine, Boz Scaggs, Marc Bolan, Judy Mowatt, Hugo Montenegro, Aretha Franklin, the Doobie Brothers, Kris Kristofferson, Smokey Robinson, Diana Ross, Al Kooper, the Jeff Healey Band, the Doors, Robin Zander, Lone Justice, the Mamas & the Papas, David Byrne, Marty Balin, Sarah Vaughan, Tommy Bolin, Ozark Mountain Daredevils, Harry Chapin and Tracy Chapman.[17] She has recorded as percussionist and drummer using the following instruments: bongos, congas, tambourine, claves, quica, wood block, tabla, full drum kit, tom-toms, cabasa, maracas, cowbell, bells, shaker, güiro, triangle, mark tree, hand claps, finger snaps[1] and finger cymbals.[18][19] These songs recorded with Hall appeared on the Billboard Hot 100 chart:', 'Lyudmila Iosifovna Vlasova (Russian: Людми́ла Ио́сифовна Вла́сова; born March 2, 1942 in Moscow, USSR) is a Soviet ballet dancer,[1] soloist of the Bolshoi Theatre[2] (1961-1982), actress.

After news of his absence, the Soviet authorities sent Lyudmila Vlasova, from a single company, on a plane to Moscow. However, the aircraft was detained by US authorities just before take-off, and the US State Department asked to provide evidence that the Vlasov returned to the Soviet Union voluntarily.[3] Following this incident to the leaders of the USSR and the USA were involved Leonid Brezhnev and Jimmy Carter. In the end, after 3 days the aircraft with Vlasova was allowed to fly to the Soviet Union.[4] After returning to Moscow, Leonid Vlasov continued to dance at the Bolshoi Theater all their games. After 2 years, Vlasov and Godunov officially dissolved through the embassy.[5] After the ballet career Lyudmila Vlasova became a sought-after choreographer in ice dancing.

It initially distributed films that were in the public domain such as It\\'s a Wonderful Life. It then moved to buying distribution rights. The first film it produced that won an award was Seasons of the Heart.[3] Feature Films for Families has made several direct-to-video movies. Included are titles such as The ButterCream Gang, Rigoletto, The Velveteen Rabbit, Picture Perfect, On Our Own, and The Retrievers. In 2009, Feature Films for Families and the Dove Foundation together paid $70,000 to Missouri\\'s Merchandising Practices Revolving Fund after using the Dove Foundation to solicit on behalf of the for-profit Feature Films for Families to attempt to evade the Missouri No Call law. Feature Films for Families had created an alliance with the Dove Foundation, a non-profit foundation which is known for its activities of rating, reviewing, and endorsing films. The two companies worked together via telemarketing, but because Feature Films for Families is a for-profit corporation, this allegiance violated Missouri\\'s No Call law.[4] In 2010, Verizon Wireless filed suit against Feature Films for Families after the company allegedly placed nearly 500,000 illegal automated telemarketing calls in ten days to the mobile phones on Verizon\\'s network. The calls were recorded advertisements for the FFFF film The Velveteen Rabbit.[5] In a related suit in May 2011, the Justice Department, acting for the Federal Trade Commission, filed a complaint[6] in U.S. District Court in Florida charging Feature Films for Families, Inc., its owner Forrest S. Baker III, and two other companies owned by Baker — named \"Corporations for Character, L.C.\" and \"Family Films of Utah\" — with \"waging deceptive and illegal telemarketing campaigns pitching movies and soliciting for donations, including calls to more than 16 million phone numbers on the National Do Not Call Registry.\"[2] The complaint seeks \"a court order to permanently bar the defendants from violating the FTC Act and the Telemarketing Sales Rule, as well as civil penalties, and disgorgement of their ill-gotten gains.\"[2] Among the behavior described by the complaint:', 'Louis W. \"Lou\" Zaeske, Jr. (December 17, 1941 – August 30, 2011) was a mechanical engineer and a political activist from Bryan, Texas. In 1988, he founded the interest group, the American Ethnic Coalition, which lobbied for English as the official language of the United States.   Zaeske was born at Randolph Air Force Base, then Randolph Field, in San Antonio, the son of Louis Zaeske, Sr. (1906–1991) and Agnes V. Zaeske (née Prihoda; 1910–1999).[1] Louis and Agnes Zaeske are interred at New Bremen Cemetery near Coy City in Karnes County, Texas.[2] The senior Zaeske made his career in the United States Air Force, and the family lived in various parts of the United States. Zaeske graduated in 1964 from Texas A&M University in College Station Station with a Bachelor of Science degree in mechanical engineering. He was a member of the TAMU Corps of Cadets and a squadron commanding officer. He subsequently studied at the graduate level at Purdue University in West Lafayette, Indiana. For more than thirty-five years, he operated Zaeske Engineering Company in Bryan.[3] Himself of German and Czech descent, Zaeske was heavily involved in the promotion of Czech heritage groups. He frequently made public presentations on the migration of the Czech peoples from Eastern Europe. For many years, Zaeske was the president of the Brazos Valley Czech Heritage Society in Bryan.[4] Zaeske was a member of the Czech Educational Foundation of Texas, which has established chairs for Czech studies at TAMU, the University of Texas at Austin and the University of North Texas at Denton.[5] He was also affiliated with the Burleson County\\'s Czech Heritage Museum, and the Kolache Festival in Caldwell, as well as the Texas Czech Heritage and Cultural Center[6] in La Grange.[3] Zaeske helped found the Texas Polka Music Museum in Schulenburg.[7] In 1990, Zaeske ran unsuccessfully as a Republican for the Texas State Senate because the Democratic incumbent in Senate District 5, Kent Caperton, refused to support Official English.[8] Caperton, however, decided not seek reelection,[9] and the Democrat James W. \"Jim\" Turner, subsequently elected in 1996 as a U.S. representative, defeated Zaeske for the seat.[10] The American Ethnic Coalition claimed that twenty-three members of the Texas State Legislature and four U.S. representatives from Texas, all of whom were elected with coalition backing and took office in 1989, were committed to Officlal English. Zaeske\\'s organization called for abolition of the printing of literature in Spanish by the Texas Workforce Commission and allowing public school districts to reject bilingual education programs. Zaeske urged that Texas Comptroller Bob Bullock be required to report to the legislature on taxpayer costs of bilingual programs and that Attorney General Jim Mattox rule on the constitutionality of such measures. Zaeske\\'s coalition proposed that foreign instructors in Texas public colleges. many of whom teach basic courses at universities, be required to pass an English proficiency test. Zaeske also spoke against a Texas law that permits lower tuition for students from Mexico who attend Texas public colleges: \"We really can\\'t understand why the citizens of this state should be required to underwrite foreigners going to school here when many of the children of citizens of this state are unable to go to college here because of not being able to pay the tuition.\"[11] In 1992, Zaeske supported Patrick J. Buchanan\\'s unsuccessful insurgent challenge to the renomination of U.S. President George Herbert Walker Bush.[12] In 1993, Zaeske ran as an Independent in a special election for the United States Senate seat vacated by incoming United States Secretary of the Treasury Lloyd M. Bentsen. He polled barely 2,000 votes, which was handily won in a runoff by the Republican state treasurer Kay Bailey Hutchison.[13] In 2008, Zaeske and his wife, Jo Ann (née Macha), supported former Governor Mike Huckabee of Arkansas for the Republican presidential nomination, ultimately won by U.S. Senator John McCain of Arizona. Jo Ann Zaeske told an interviewer that their support for Huckabee was based on the candidate\\'s embrace of \"family values.\" Lou Zaeske said that could not support McCain in part because of McCain\\'s divorce. He even indicated that he would vote for Barack H. Obama in a contest against McCain because he thought that Obama could work across party lines, an argument also used at the time by the McCain supporters.[14] Zaeske died at the age of sixty-nine at St. Joseph Regional Health Center in Bryan, Texas. In addition to his wife of forty-seven years, he was survived by two daughters and five grandchildren.[3]', 'The 11 foot 8 Bridge, also known as the Norfolk Southern–Gregson Street Overpass, located in Durham, North Carolina, United States, is a railroad bridge that has attracted media attention, including front-page coverage in The Wall Street Journal,[1] because of the frequency of collisions due to the bridge\\'s unusually low clearance. Overheight vehicles such as trucks and RVs frequently collide with the abnormally low overpass, resulting in damage ranging from RV roof air conditioners being scraped off, to entire truck roofs themselves being peeled off. The media has focused on video clips of the crashes, which are posted on the Internet for public viewing.[2] This railroad overpass along South Gregson Street in Durham, North Carolina, provides only 11\\xa0feet 8\\xa0inches (3.56\\xa0m) of vertical clearance.[3] The 77-year-old bridge cannot be raised, because nearby railroad crossings would also have to be raised. The street cannot be lowered, because a major sewer line runs only four feet (1.2\\xa0m) under Gregson Street.[4] Despite numerous signs and warning devices, a truck crashes into the bridge on average at least once a month. Most of the crashes involve rental trucks, even though the truck rental agencies warn renters about the under-height bridges in the area. Jürgen Henn, who works in a nearby office, mounted a video camera to record the crashes. Since April 2008, he has recorded over 100 crashes, and posted them on YouTube.[5] In less than a year after installing his camera, the videos attracted the attention of a local TV station,[6] and eventually progressed to international media attention.[1] The bridge is only one of several under-height bridges in the area that trucks frequently crash into;[7] however, the videos became viral, and brought this particular bridge to international media attention. As of January 2016[update], there have been no fatalities and only one minor injury at the bridge, leading officials to concentrate on more urgent safety issues.   The state of North Carolina owns all the shares of the North Carolina Railroad Company, which owns the land and the bridge. North Carolina Railroad owns no rolling stock, but leases tracks to Amtrak and Norfolk Southern Railway.[8] A heavy steel crash beam protects the bridge from over-height trucks, but does nothing to prevent crashes or protect the trucks. The crash beam has been hit so often that it has had to be replaced at least once. The Transportation Department of the City of Durham maintains Gregson Street, which runs under the bridge. The city installed height detectors on Gregson a block before the bridge. When an over-height truck passes by the detector, yellow warning lights flash to alert the drivers of trucks that will not clear the low underpass. Unfortunately, many drivers fail to heed the warnings, and crash into the bridge. A solution to the problem is complicated by the location of Peabody Street, which runs parallel to the tracks, and intersects Gregson, just before the bridge. Not all truck traffic traveling on Gregson will continue under the bridge. Some large trucks must turn right onto Peabody to make deliveries to businesses on Peabody. Over-height trucks are allowed on Gregson, as long as they turn just before the bridge. In May 2016, the city attempted to solve the problem by installing a traffic signal at the intersection.[9] When an over-height truck approaches, the light turns red and a screen displays the message \"OVERHEIGHT MUST TURN\". The light will eventually turn green again, regardless of whether or not the truck driver chooses to do so. The city hoped the long delay would give drivers of over-height trucks time to realize their truck will not fit under the bridge. However, another truck was recorded striking under the bridge on July 6, 2016.[9] In 2014, the North Carolina Department of Transportation (NCDOT) Rail Division and the City of Durham began a \"Traffic Separation Study\" of 18 rail crossings over a 12-mile (19\\xa0km) section of the railroad. Gregson Street is in the middle of that section of track, but was not mentioned in the study. The study focused on eliminating at-grade crossings, not on fixing existing grade separated crossings. There have been four fatalities and two other injuries in the study area since 1991, compared to only one minor injury at Gregson, and the 11 foot 8 Bridge already provides grade separation at Gregson. The study did recommend replacing the existing bridge at Roxboro Street, because it has a vertical clearance of only 11\\xa0feet 4\\xa0inches (3.45\\xa0m), and \"Many trucks have gotten stuck under the Roxboro Street railroad bridge.\"[10] Local news has reported crashes at the Roxboro Street bridge.[7][11] As of January 2016[update], recommendations made in the study have not been implemented.', \"Peninsula Campaign Henry Dwight Terry (March 16, 1812 – June 22, 1869) was a United States Army Brigadier general who fought in the American Civil War. Terry was born in Hartford, Connecticut. Despite his roots in New England, he moved to the state of Michigan as a young man, where he studied law and later practiced in Detroit.[2] Terry took an active interest in military matters. When the Civil War began, he recruited and organized the 5th Michigan Infantry, becoming its colonel on June 10, 1861. During the war's first winter, he and his regiment served in the defenses of Washington D.C..[1] Throughout the 1862 Peninsula Campaign, the 5th Michigan was attached to Brigadier General Samuel P. Heintzelman's III Corps, Army of the Potomac. It sustained heavy losses at both Williamsburg and Seven Pines, and in mid-July Terry was promoted to Brigadier General of Volunteers.[2] Early in 1863, as a part of the VII Corps, his brigade, composed of men from New York, Michigan, and Pennsylvania, was sent to Suffolk, Virginia. There, in April and May, it was besieged by Confederates under Lieutenant General James Longstreet. Once the siege was lifted, Terry reported to Major General John A. Dix, who in late June shipped his brigade up the York and Pamunkey rivers to White House, Virginia. For the next three weeks Terry participated in an operation threatening General Robert E. Lee's communications line to Richmond during the Confederate invasion of Pennsylvania.[1][2] On July 1, 1863, while attached to Major General Erasmus D. Keyes's IV Corps, Terry's command marched to Baltimore Cross Roads, within striking distance of the Confederate capital, where it encountered a scratch force of defenders. Terry, however, fed Keyes' fear that the enemy in great numbers were gathering in their rear, cutting their line of retreat. This helped persuade Keyes to retreat toward White House late on July 2. In the wake of the botched offensive, Dix and Keyes lost their field commands but Terry was returned to the Army of the Potomac, where that autumn he led a division in the VI Corps. His force supported Major General Gouverneur K. Warren's V Corps during the abortive Mine Run Campaign that November. Less than two months later, the division was sent to garrison the prison camp on Johnson's Island, Ohio.[1] In May 1864, when the division returned to Virginia for the spring campaign, Terry found himself superseded and left idle. At this point he disappears from official military records. He remained on inactive duty until his resignation on February 7, 1865. After leaving the service, he resumed his law practice in Washington D.C. He died there on June 22, 1869, at the age of 57 and was buried in Clinton Grove Cemetery, near Detroit.[2]\", 'A search engine is an information retrieval software program that discovers, crawls, transforms and stores information for retrieval and presentation in response to user queries.[1] A search engine normally consists of four components e.g. search interface, crawler(also known as a spider or bot),indexer, and database. The crawler traverses a document collection, deconstructs document text, and assigns surrogates for storage in the search engine index. Online search engines store images, link data and metadata for the document as well.   The concept of hypertext and a memory extension originates from an article that was published in The Atlantic Monthly in July 1945 written by Vannevar Bush, titled As We May Think. Within this article Vannevar urged scientists to work together to help build a body of knowledge for all mankind. He then proposed the idea of a virtually limitless, fast, reliable, extensible, associative memory storage and retrieval system. He named this device a memex.[2] Bush regarded the notion of “associative indexing” as his key conceptual contribution. As he explained, this was “a provision whereby any item may be caused at will to select immediately and automatically another. This is the essential feature of the memex. The process of tying two items together is the important thing.” This “linking” (as we now say) constituted a “trail” of documents that could be named, coded, and found again. Moreover, after the original two items were coupled, “numerous items” could be “joined together to form a trail”; they could be “reviewed in turn, rapidly or slowly, by deflecting a lever like that used for turning the pages of a book. It is exactly as though the physical items had been gathered together from widely separated sources and bound together to form a new book”[3] All of the documents used in the memex would be in the form of microfilm copy acquired as such or, in the case of personal records, transformed to microfilm by the machine itself. Memex would also employ new retrieval techniques based on a new kind of associative indexing the basic idea of which is a provision whereby any item may be caused at will to select immediately and automatically another to create personal \"trails\" through linked documents. The new procedures, that Bush anticipated facilitating information storage and retrieval would lead to the development of wholly new forms of encyclopedia. The most important mechanism, conceived by Bush and considered as closed to the modern hypertext systems is the associative trail. It would be a way to create a new linear sequence of microfilm frames across any arbitrary sequence of microfilm frames by creating a chained sequence of links in the way just described, along with personal comments and side trails. The essential feature of the memex [is] the process of tying two items together… When the user is building a trail, he names it in his code book, and taps it out on his keyboard. Before him are the two items to be joined, projected onto adjacent viewing positions. At the bottom of each there are a number of blank code spaces, and a pointer is set to indicate one of these on each item. The user taps a single key, and the items are permanently joined… Thereafter, at any time, when one of these items is in view, the other can be instantly recalled merely by tapping a button below the corresponding code space. In the article of Bush is not described any automatic search, nor any universal metadata scheme such as a standard library classification or a hypertext element set. Instead, when the user made an entry, such as a new or annotated manuscript, or image, he was expected to index and describe it in his personal code book. Later on, by consulting his code book, the user could retrace annotated and generated entries. In 1965 Bush took part in the project INTREX of MIT, for developing technology for mechanization the processing of information for library use. In his 1967 essay titled \"Memex Revisited\", he pointed out that the development of the digital computer, the transistor, the video, and other similar devices had heightened the feasibility of such mechanization, but costs would delay its achievements. He was right again. Ted Nelson, who later did pioneering work with first practical hypertext system and coined the term \"hypertext\" in the 1960s, credited Bush as his main influence.[4] Gerard Salton, who died on August 28 of 1995, was the father of modern search technology. His teams at Harvard and Cornell developed the SMART informational retrieval system. Salton’s Magic Automatic Retriever of Text included important concepts like the vector space model, Inverse Document Frequency (IDF), Term Frequency (TF), term discrimination values, and relevancy feedback mechanisms. He authored a 56-page book called A Theory of Indexing which explained many of his tests upon which search is still largely based. In 1987 an article was published detailing the development of a character string search engine (SSE) for rapid text retrieval on a double-metal 1.6-μm n-well CMOS solid-state circuit with 217,600 transistors lain out on a 8.62x12.76-mm die area. The SSE accommodated a novel string-search architecture which combines a 512-stage finite-state automaton (FSA) logic with a content addressable memory (CAM) to achieve an approximate string comparison of 80 million strings per second. The CAM cell consisted of four conventional static RAM (SRAM) cells and a read/write circuit. Concurrent comparison of 64 stored strings with variable length was achieved in 50 ns for an input text stream of 10 million characters/s, permitting performance despite the presence of single character errors in the form of character codes. Furthermore, the chip allowed nonanchor string search and variable-length `don\\'t care\\' (VLDC) string search.[5]  The first web search engines was Archie, created in 1990[6] by Alan Emtage, a student at McGill University in Montreal. The author originally wanted to call the program \"archives,\" but had to shorten it to comply with the Unix world standard of assigning programs and files short, cryptic names such as grep, cat, troff, sed, awk, perl, and so on. The primary method of storing and retrieving files was via the File Transfer Protocol (FTP). This was (and still is) a system that specified a common way for computers to exchange files over the Internet. It works like this: Some administrator decides that he wants to make files available from his computer. He sets up a program on his computer, called an FTP server. When someone on the Internet wants to retrieve a file from this computer, he or she connects to it via another program called an FTP client. Any FTP client program can connect with any FTP server program as long as the client and server programs both fully follow the specifications set forth in the FTP protocol. Initially, anyone who wanted to share a file had to set up an FTP server in order to make the file available to others. Later, \"anonymous\" FTP sites became repositories for files, allowing all users to post and retrieve them. Even with archive sites, many important files were still scattered on small FTP servers. Unfortunately, these files could be located only by the Internet equivalent of word of mouth: Somebody would post an e-mail to a message list or a discussion forum announcing the availability of a file. Archie changed all that. It combined a script-based data gatherer, which fetched site listings of anonymous FTP files, with a regular expression matcher for retrieving file names matching a user query. (4) In other words, Archie\\'s gatherer scoured FTP sites across the Internet and indexed all of the files it found. Its regular expression matcher provided users with access to its database.[7] In 1993, the University of Nevada System Computing Services group developed Veronica.[6] It was created as a type of searching device similar to Archie but for Gopher files. Another Gopher search service, called Jughead, appeared a little later, probably for the sole purpose of rounding out the comic-strip triumvirate. Jughead is an acronym for Jonzy\\'s Universal Gopher Hierarchy Excavation and Display, although, like Veronica, it is probably safe to assume that the creator backed into the acronym. Jughead\\'s functionality was pretty much identical to Veronica\\'s, although it appears to be a little rougher around the edges.[7] The World Wide Web Wanderer, developed by Matthew Gray in 1993[8] was the first robot on the Web and was designed to track the Web\\'s growth. Initially, the Wanderer counted only Web servers, but shortly after its introduction, it started to capture URLs as it went along. The database of captured URLs became the Wandex, the first web database. Matthew Gray\\'s Wanderer created quite a controversy at the time, partially because early versions of the software ran rampant through the Net and caused a noticeable netwide performance degradation. This degradation occurred because the Wanderer would access the same page hundreds of time a day. The Wanderer soon amended its ways, but the controversy over whether robots were good or bad for the Internet remained. In response to the Wanderer, Martijn Koster created Archie-Like Indexing of the Web, or ALIWEB, in October 1993. As the name implies, ALIWEB was the HTTP equivalent of Archie, and because of this, it is still unique in many ways. ALIWEB does not have a web-searching robot. Instead, webmasters of participating sites post their own index information for each page they want listed. The advantage to this method is that users get to describe their own site, and a robot doesn\\'t run about eating up Net bandwidth. Unfortunately, the disadvantages of ALIWEB are more of a problem today. The primary disadvantage is that a special indexing file must be submitted. Most users do not understand how to create such a file, and therefore they don\\'t submit their pages. This leads to a relatively small database, which meant that users are less likely to search ALIWEB than one of the large bot-based sites. This Catch-22 has been somewhat offset by incorporating other databases into the ALIWEB search, but it still does not have the mass appeal of search engines such as Yahoo! or Lycos.[7] Excite, initially called Architext, was started by six Stanford undergraduates in February 1993. Their idea was to use statistical analysis of word relationships in order to provide more efficient searches through the large amount of information on the Internet. Their project was fully funded by mid-1993. Once funding was secured. they released a version of their search software for webmasters to use on their own web sites. At the time, the software was called Architext, but it now goes by the name of Excite for Web Servers.[7] Excite was the first serious commercial search engine which launched in 1995.[9] It was developed in Stanford and was purchased for $6.5 billion by @Home. In 2001 Excite and @Home went bankrupt and InfoSpace bought Excite for $10 million. Some of the first analysis of web searching was conducted on search logs from Excite[10][11] In April 1994, two Stanford University Ph.D. candidates, David Filo and Jerry Yang, created some pages that became rather popular. They called the collection of pages Yahoo! Their official explanation for the name choice was that they considered themselves to be a pair of yahoos. As the number of links grew and their pages began to receive thousands of hits a day, the team created ways to better organize the data. In order to aid in data retrieval, Yahoo! (www.yahoo.com) became a searchable directory. The search feature was a simple database search engine. Because Yahoo! entries were entered and categorized manually, Yahoo! was not really classified as a search engine. Instead, it was generally considered to be a searchable directory. Yahoo! has since automated some aspects of the gathering and classification process, blurring the distinction between engine and directory. The Wanderer captured only URLs, which made it difficult to find things that weren’t explicitly described by their URL. Because URLs are rather cryptic to begin with, this didn’t help the average user. Searching Yahoo! or the Galaxy was much more effective because they contained additional descriptive information about the indexed sites. At Carnegie Mellon University during July 1994, Michael Mauldin, on leave from CMU,developed the Lycos search engine. Search engines on the web are sites enriched with facility to search the content stored on other sites. There is difference in the way various search engines work, but they all perform three basic tasks.[12] The process begins when a user enters a query statement into the system through the interface provided. There are basically three types of search engines: Those that are powered by robots (called crawlers; ants or spiders) and those that are powered by human submissions; and those that are a hybrid of the two. Crawler-based search engines are those that use automated software agents (called crawlers) that visit a Web site, read the information on the actual site, read the site\\'s meta tags and also follow the links that the site connects to performing indexing on all linked Web sites as well. The crawler returns all that information back to a central depository, where the data is indexed. The crawler will periodically return to the sites to check for any information that has changed. The frequency with which this happens is determined by the administrators of the search engine. Human-powered search engines rely on humans to submit information that is subsequently indexed and catalogued. Only information that is submitted is put into the index. In both cases, when you query a search engine to locate information, you\\'re actually searching through the index that the search engine has created —you are not actually searching the Web. These indices are giant databases of information that is collected and stored and subsequently searched. This explains why sometimes a search on a commercial search engine, such as Yahoo! or Google, will return results that are, in fact, dead links. Since the search results are based on the index, if the index hasn\\'t been updated since a Web page became invalid the search engine treats the page as still an active link even though it no longer is. It will remain that way until the index is updated. So why will the same search on different search engines produce different results? Part of the answer to that question is because not all indices are going to be exactly the same. It depends on what the spiders find or what the humans submitted. But more important, not every search engine uses the same algorithm to search through the indices. The algorithm is what the search engines use to determine the relevance of the information in the index to what the user is searching for. One of the elements that a search engine algorithm scans for is the frequency and location of keywords on a Web page. Those with higher frequency are typically considered more relevant. But search engine technology is becoming sophisticated in its attempt to discourage what is known as keyword stuffing, or spamdexing. Another common element that algorithms analyze is the way that pages link to other pages in the Web. By analyzing how pages link to each other, an engine can both determine what a page is about (if the keywords of the linked pages are similar to the keywords on the original page) and whether that page is considered \"important\" and deserving of a boost in ranking. Just as the technology is becoming increasingly sophisticated to ignore keyword stuffing, it is also becoming more savvy to Web masters who build artificial links into their sites in order to build an artificial ranking. Modern web search engines are highly intricate software systems that employ technology that has evolved over the years. There are a number of sub-categories of search engine software that are separately applicable to specific \\'browsing\\' needs. These include web search engines (e.g. Google), database or structured data search engines (e.g. Dieselpoint), and mixed search engines or enterprise search. The more prevalent search engines, such as Google and Yahoo!, utilize hundreds of thousands computers to process trillions of web pages in order to return fairly well-aimed results. Due to this high volume of queries and text processing, the software is required to run in a highly dispersed environment with a high degree of superfluity. Search engines that are expressly designed for searching web pages, documents, and images were developed to facilitate searching through a large, nebulous blob of unstructured resources. They are engineered to follow a multi-stage process: crawling the infinite stockpile of pages and documents to skim the figurative foam from their contents, indexing the foam/buzzwords in a sort of semi-structured form (database or something), and at last, resolving user entries/queries to return mostly relevant results and links to those skimmed documents or pages from the inventory. In the case of a wholly textual search, the first step in classifying web pages is to find an ‘index item’ that might relate expressly to the ‘search term.’ In the past, search engines began with a small list of URLs as a so-called seed list, fetched the content, and parsed the links on those pages for relevant information, which subsequently provided new links. The process was highly cyclical and continued until enough pages were found for the searcher’s use. These days, a continuous crawl method is employed as opposed to an incidental discovery based on a seed list. The crawl method is an extension of aforementioned discovery method. Except there is no seed list, because the system never stops worming. Most search engines use sophisticated scheduling algorithms to “decide” when to revisit a particular page, to appeal to its relevance. These algorithms range from constant visit-interval with higher priority for more frequently changing pages to adaptive visit-interval based on several criteria such as frequency of change, popularity, and overall quality of site. The speed of the web server running the page as well as resource constraints like amount of hardware or bandwidth also figure in. The pages that are discovered by web crawls are often distributed and fed into another computer that creates a veritable map of resources uncovered. The bunchy clustermass looks a little like a graph, on which the different pages are represented as small nodes that are connected by links between the pages. The excess of data is stored in multiple data structures that permit quick access to said data by certain algorithms that compute the popularity score of pages on the web based on how many links point to a certain web page, which is how people can access any number of resources concerned with diagnosing psychosis. Another example would be the accessibility/rank of web pages containing information on Mohamed Morsi versus the very best attractions to visit in Cairo after simply entering ‘Egypt’ as a search term. One such algorithm, PageRank, proposed by Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, is well known and has attracted a lot of attention because it highlights repeat mundanity of web searches courtesy of students that don’t know how to properly research subjects on Google. The idea of doing link analysis to compute a popularity rank is older than PageRank. Other variants of the same idea are currently in use – grade schoolers do the same sort of computations in picking kickball teams. But in all seriousness, these ideas can be categorized into three main categories: rank of individual pages and nature of web site content. Search engines often differentiate between internal links and external links, because web masters and mistresses are not strangers to shameless self-promotion. Link map data structures typically store the anchor text embedded in the links as well, because anchor text can often provide a “very good quality” summary of a web page’s content. Searching for text-based content in databases presents a few special challenges from which a number of specialized search engines flourish. Databases can be slow when solving complex queries (with multiple logical or string matching arguments). Databases allow pseudo-logical queries which full-text searches do not use. There is no crawling necessary for a database since the data is already structured. However, it is often necessary to index the data in a more economized form to allow a more expeditious search. Sometimes, data searched contains both database content and web pages or documents. Search engine technology has developed to respond to both sets of requirements. Most mixed search engines are large Web search engines, like Google. They search both through structured and unstructured data sources. Take for example, the word ‘ball.’ In its simplest terms, it returns more than 40 variations on Wikipedia alone. Did you mean a ball, as in the social gathering/dance? A soccer ball? The ball of the foot? Pages and documents are crawled and indexed in a separate index. Databases are indexed also from various sources. Search results are then generated for users by querying these multiple indices in parallel and compounding the results according to “rules.” ', 'Joe Dean Davenport (born October 29, 1976 in Springdale, Arkansas) is a former American football tight end in the National Football League (NFL).', 'The Southedge Dam, also known as the Lake Mitchell Dam,[1] is an earth filled embankment dam across the Mitchell River located in Far North Queensland, Australia.

', 'In control theory, the coefficient diagram method (CDM) is an algebraic approach applied to a polynomial loop in the parameter space, where a special diagram called a \"coefficient diagram\" is used as the vehicle to carry the necessary information, and as the criterion of good design.[1] The performance of the closed loop system is monitored by the coefficient diagram. The most considerable advantages of CDM can be listed as follows:[2] 1. The design procedure is easily understandable, systematic and useful. Therefore, the coefficients of the CDM controller polynomials can be determined more easily than those of the PID or other types of controller. This creates the possibility of an easy realisation for a new designer to control any kind of system. 2. There are explicit relations between the performance parameters specified before the design and the coefficients of the controller polynomials as described in.[3] For this reason, the designer can easily realize many control systems having different performance properties for a given control problem in a wide range of freedom. 3. The development of different tuning methods is required for time delay processes of different properties in PID control. But it is sufficient to use the single design procedure in the CDM technique. This is an outstanding advantage.[4] 4. It is particularly hard to design robust controllers realizing the desired performance properties for unstable, integrating and oscillatory processes having poles near the imaginary axis. It has been reported that successful designs can be achieved even in these cases by using CDM.[5] 5. It is theoretically proven that CDM design is equivalent to LQ design with proper state augmentation. Thus, CDM can be considered an ‘‘improved LQG’’, because the order of the controller is smaller and weight selection rules are also given.[6] It is usually required that the controller for a given plant should be designed under some practical limitations. The controller is desired to be of minimum degree, minimum phase (if possible) and stable. It must have enough bandwidth and power rating limitations. If the controller is designed without considering these limitations, the robustness property will be very poor, even though the stability and time response requirements are met. CDM controllers designed while considering all these problems is of the lowest degree, has a convenient bandwidth and results with a unit step time response without an overshoot. These properties guarantee the robustness, the sufficient damping of the disturbance effects and the low economic property.[7] Although the main principles of CDM have been known since the 1950s,[8][9][10] the first systematic method was proposed by Shunji Manabe.[11] He developed a new method that easily builds a target characteristic polynomial to meet the desired time response. CDM is an algebraic approach combining classical and modern control theories and uses polynomial representation in the mathematical expression. The advantages of the classical and modern control techniques are integrated with the basic principles of this method, which is derived by making use of the previous experience and knowledge of the controller design. Thus, an efficient and fertile control method has appeared as a tool with which control systems can be designed without needing much experience and without confronting many problems. Many control systems have been designed successfully using CDM.[12][13] It is very easy to design a controller under the conditions of stability, time domain performance and robustness. The close relations between these conditions and coefficients of the characteristic polynomial can be simply determined. This means that CDM is effective not only for control system design but also for controller parameters tuning. .', \"Keysville is a city in Burke and Jefferson counties in the U.S. state of Georgia.

Kyle Mooney plays stand-up comedian Bruce Chandling. Reese De\\'What (Kenan Thompson) presents classic cinema and television. Three surly and unusually-named news anchors of a Miami-based morning news program (played by Kate McKinnon, Bobby Moynihan, and the host) cheerfully record their promos for the week for their off-screen producer (voiced by Vanessa Bayer). An installment of Mornin\\' Miami! was scheduled to air on May 10, 2014, featuring host Charlize Theron; the sketch was cut from the episode before airing, but was released online. Unusually perky poetry teacher Miss Meadows (Vanessa Bayer) visits students and teaches them about the joys of poetry. She reads her eccentric original poems to the group. Students take turns reading their odd original poems with one student (played by the host) using their poems to display their sexual attraction towards Meadows. A look in the fictional romance of Miley Cyrus and Kyle Mooney, which takes place during and after the filming of a homemade videotape. Bobby Moynihan and Beck Bennett interrupt the shooting, to which Kyle exits the room and confides in them that he doesn\\'t really want to do what Miley wants him to do in the tape. Every time he opens the door after that, her actions and situations become more outlandish. A guest speaker (played by the Host) visits Astoria Elementary School to give a safety presentation, but finds that the loud, brash student Shallon (Nasim Pedrad) twists his lecture into an endorsement of whatever he\\'s warning the children against (such as getting into cars with strangers) while the class\\' teacher Miss Finley (Kate McKinnon) is away doing something in her car. Shallon\\'s actions would get her classmates (played by Aidy Bryant, John Milhiser, Bobby Moynihan, Kenan Thompson, and Noël Wells) into thinking that what Shallon says is right much to the chagrin of the guest speaker. When Miss Finley returns, the guest speaker leaves and makes a negative comment about the class. Afterwards, Miss Finley gives the children permission to go pursue the activity the guest speaker was attempting to discourage. Heshy Farahat (Nasim Pedrad) is a Yemeni motivational speaker who comes to speak at schools and hotels, etc. She often tells personal stories to motivate the audience, using hip thrusts and shooting-gun sound effects controlled by her son (Mike O\\'Brien). Kanye West (Jay Pharoah) and Kim Kardashian (Nasim Pedrad) host a morning talk show with a typical daytime-talk-show format. Despite Kanye feeding Kim each of her lines to say in extremely obvious ways, she messes up most of them anyway. Kanye appears to be oblivious to Kim\\'s ditziness, seeing her as both beautiful and brilliant. The other Kardashian sisters make giggling nasal-voiced appearances. Jebidiah Atkinson (Taran Killam), a Weekend Update character, is an 1860s newspaper critic who has something negative to say about everything. The character was inspired by an actual incident: On November 14, 2013, in honor of the 150th anniversary of Abraham Lincoln\\'s Gettysburg Address, The Patriot-News retracted a scathing review of the address that its predecessor publication, The Patriot & Union, had published on Nov. 24, 1863. Atkinson, ostensibly the author of that review, appeared on Weekend Update to defend his opinion. (The actual author was Oramel Barrett.)[1] The character has received critical acclaim from multiple reviewers. Mike Ryan of the Huffington Post said he would watch a Jebidiah Atkinson movie.[2] Hitfix\\'s Ryan McGee said that while performing the bit, Killam was on fire, even comparing Atkinson to Bill Hader\\'s beloved Weekend Update character Stefon.[3] Dick Patterson (Beck Bennett) is a businessman who exhibits infantile reflexes.

', \"The Otago Sparks are a New Zealand women's cricket team that plays in the State League. \", 'Park of Friendship in New Belgrade [1] is one of the largest parks in Belgrade.   The park is located in New Belgrade in the local community Ušće and it extends to a large green area from Hotel Yugoslavia along the Danube and the Sava River to Branko’s Bridge. It is lined with the Mihailo Pupin Boulevard, Ušće and street Nikola Tesla Boulevard. It borders Veliko ratno ostrvo and Malo ratno ostrvo, and the city center of Belgrade through the Danube and the Sava River. Friendship Park covers an area of 14 hectares. It can be reached by local bus by bus lines 15[2] and 84.[3] The park includes a large number of green areas and trees and it leads to the river Sava and river Danube. It is suitable for walking, physical activity or relaxation in nature. The park also has a bike path and a running trail. Although located near the center of Belgrade, peace and quiet prevails in the park. Within the park, there is also Skate Park Ušće. The idea for the establishment of the Friendship Park of memorial character came from Young Gorani who, in the name of holding the first Conference of NAM in Belgrade in 1961, decided to establish a memorial park as a symbol of the struggle for peace and equality for all peoples in the world. On 29 August 1961, their initiative was supported by the Council for Culture and the Council for Urban Planning of the National Committee of the City of Belgrade. Тito’s planting plane trees on 7 September 1961 was considered the grand opening of the Park. The first preliminary design was done by engineer Vladeta Đorđević, but the final solution regarding the appearance and organization of park space is shown in the project called \"Potez,\" which won first prize at the Yugoslav competition in 1965. The Belgrade City Assembly and the committee on taking care of the construction and development of the park announced an all-Yugoslav competition.[4] The specificity of the subject matter was a challenge to the authors since it treated the field of horticulture, not so frequent competition matter, and the position of the park among the most important government buildings, the Palace of the Federal Executive Council and the former building of the CK CPY (today BC Ušće), Мuseum of Contemporary Art and Hotel Yugoslavia. Nineteen works took part in the competition, of which three were awarded and eleven were purchased. The first prize was won by the work under the code \"Potez\" by the architect Milan Pališaški. The second prize was shared by the architects Ranko Radović and Ljiljana Pekić, and the third prize went to the architect Mira Holambek-Bencler from Zagreb. The construction of the park was symbolically marked the establishment of the Non-Aligned Movement, one of the whose founders was Yugoslavia. The work of the architect Pališaški, according to the selection panel, was a strict geometric solution with geometrical divisions and monumental size, ceremonial and representative.[5] The Avenue of Peace with the memorial obelisk \"Eternal Flame\" [6] is located in the central part of the park. The park features a flower statue of the sculptor Lidija Mišić. Peace Avenue with 26 plane trees that were planted by statesmen, during a conference of the NAM in Belgrade until 1989, is 180 m long, which also represents the number of countries which had a commitment to peace as their political priority, through the so-called policy of peaceful, active coexistence. All participants of the First Conference planted the same plant – plane tree. The selection of plane trees is their longevity, which emphasizes the idea of establishing a lasting peace in the world. Next to each planted tree is a tablet with the name of the statesman and the country of origin, year of planting, and the denomination of the tree Platanus acerofilia. Plane tree seedlings are placed at a distance of eight meters so that they could merge at a certain height of their growth and thus form a unique green series which also symbolizes of the connection of all nations through a common idea. From the competition solution to today, only 9.5 hectares of park area have been realized. Although little has been done out of the original idea of the architect Pališaški ,[7] specificity in the formation of a modern park is basically considered even today.[8] The monument \"Eternal Flame\" is located in the park and was built to commemorate the victims of the NATO bombing of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia. It was built according to the plans of the sculptor brothers Svetozar and Svetomir Radović and architects Marko Stevanović and Miodrag Cvijić. The monument was unveiled on 12 June 2000 on the anniversary of the end of the NATO bombing in the presence of the largest political officials. The Monument “Eternal Flame” is 28 meters high, although it was supposed to be 78 meters high, symbolizing the number of days of NATO bombing. The flame on \"Eternal Flame\" waved until 5 October 2000. Then the policemen who were guarding the monument withdrew, and unknown hooligans stormed the building with gas, damaged the installation and thus extinguished the \"Eternal Flame\". Others broke open the front door and entered the obelisk. In the same night, a group of young people removed and took the valuable spotlights. Soon after, the monument was covered with graffiti, which fully covered the inscriptions and ruined the appearance of the monument. After that, the letters from the text \"Eternal Flame\" were taken off, in which it was stated to whom the monument was dedicated. The monument was neglected until 2009, when thanks to the initiative of the Club of Generals and Admirals Serbia, the drawn messages were repainted, access to the \"Eternal flame\" was cleared, but the flame was not rekindled.[citation needed] In this park, numerous officials and celebrities planted a tree as a sign of friendship, and among them were the following: Francois Mitterrand, Јоsip Broz Tito, Jawaharlal Nehru, Gamal Abdel Nasser, Queen Elizabeth II, Fidel Castro, Мuammar Gaddafi, Emperor Haile Selassie, Leonid Brezhnev, Mikhail Gorbachev, Richard Nixon, Jimmy Carter, Todor Živkov, Nicolae Ceausescu , Kim Il Sung, Indira Gandhi and others.[9] The last official who planted a tree during the existence of the Socialist Federative Republic of Yugoslavia was the Romanian President Ion Iliesku, who planted the 194th tree in the park in 1991. Even after the breakup of Yugoslavia, the tradition of planting trees in the park was maintained, so the members of the Rolling Stones planted trees in 2007, before their concert in Belgrade.[citation needed] Monument “Eternal Flame” Memorial of the beginning of construction of New Belgrade Palace of Serbia Coordinates: 44°49′12″N 20°26′13″E\\ufeff / \\ufeff44.820°N 20.437°E\\ufeff / 44.820; 20.437', \"The Latham Report, titled Constructing the Team, was an influential report written by Sir Michael Latham, published in July 1994. Latham was commissioned by the United Kingdom government and industry organisations to review procurement and contractual arrangements in the UK construction industry, aiming to tackle controversial issues facing the industry during a period of lapse in growth as a whole.   The Latham Report was not the first report to identify systemic failings in the UK construction industry; previous reports dating back to the 1960s had identified similar issues and made similar recommendations.[1] However, this report did gain industry and government support. Latham identified industry inefficiencies, condemning existing industry practices as 'adversarial', 'ineffective', 'fragmented', 'incapable of delivering for its clients' and 'lacking respect for its employees'. He urged reform and advocated partnering and collaboration by construction companies. A key concept was that through teamwork the construction industry could delight its customers. Latham made 53 recommendations to change industry practices, to increase efficiency and to replace the bureaucratic, wasteful, adversarial atmosphere prevalent in most construction projects with one characterised by openness, co-operation, trust, honesty, commitment and mutual understanding among team members. For example: The Report spawned a raft of initiatives including the establishment of the Construction Industry Board to oversee reform. At the request of the Construction Clients' Forum (formed following Latham's recommendation), the CIB published a further report, Partnering in the Team in 1996.[1] In parallel, the industry reform group, the Reading Construction Forum, published Trusting the Team: the Best Practice Guide to Partnering in Construction in 1995 (for which Latham wrote the foreword).[3] Subsequent initiatives included the 1998 Egan Report Re-thinking construction, and the establishment of industry change organisations including the Design Build Foundation (1997) Construction Best Practice Programme, the IT Construction Best Practice Programme, Movement for Innovation and Constructing Excellence. The Latham and Egan Reports' focus on collaboration was also referenced by Chief Construction Adviser Paul Morrell in the UK government construction strategy in 2011.[4] The Latham Review commended the establishment of the Interdisciplinary Design for the Built Environment programme at the University of Cambridge (page 73) and in turn was one of the influences that helped to shape the early syllabus of the IDBE course.\", 'The Judiciary of Cyprus is the system of courts which interprets and applies the law in Cyprus. It is largely based on the English model.[1] Judicial independence is safeguarded by the Constitution.   The applicable laws in Cyprus are the Constitution, the laws of Article 188 in the Constitution, the Common Law and Equity and laws enabled by the Cyprus House of Representatives. The District Courts are courts of first instance for civil matters (except those which are dealt with by special courts such as the Family Court, the Rent Control Court, or the Industrial Disputes Court) and criminal cases involving prison sentences of five years of less. There are six such courts: Nicosia, Famagusta, Kyrenia (located in Nicosia), Larnaca, Limassol, and Paphos. The Assize Courts are courts first instance for criminal cases which involve prison sentences of more than five years. The Assize Courts consist of three judges with no jury and may be composed of either: There are four such courts: Nicosia, Larnaca, Limassol, and Paphos. The Supreme Court was established in 1964 from a merger of the Supreme Constitutional Court and the High Court. Although it can act as a court of first instance it is primarily an appeal court for both civil and criminal cases. As an appellate court the Supreme Court can review and re-examine all the evidence, request or admit other evidence and order cases to be reheard. It is composed of 13 judges, one of whom acts as the court president. The Supreme Court also acts as a constitutional, admiralty and administrative court. It can also rule on electoral issues. It is based in Nicosia. There are five Family Courts, three for Nicosia and Kyrenia, one for Limassol and Paphos and one for Larnaca and Famagusta which decide in divorce, child custody and real estate matters. There is also a family court for religious groups in Nicosia. There are two Rent Control Courts which try cases of recovery of property, property rentals and associated matters. There are three Industrial Disputes Tribunals, based in Nicosia, Larnaca and Limassol, which have jurisdiction over employment matters. The Military Court has jurisdiction over military matters.

It is 48\\xa0km in the west of Tokat Province. Turhal is situated on a fertile plain fragmented by the Yeşil Irmak river. It has an elevation of approximately 530 m. The city is best known for its sugar beet processing plant established in 1934 as an important enterprise of the young Turkish Republic. The mayor is Yılmaz Bekler (AKP).   The first nucleus of Turhal appeared as an important fortress or fortification named Talaura (Τάλαυρα in Ancient greek) on the way between today's Amasya and Tokat provinces. It is deducted from the tablets found in the region that Turhal had been inhabited as early as the third millennium BC and had relations as far as the Mesopotamian cultures such as Sumerians who had already invented an effective alphabet. The Persian invasion in Anatolia during the 6th century BC made this region an important center influenced by the cult of Zoroastrianism. The famous geographer of the antiquity, Strabo has, on various occasions, drawn up different accounts on the region describing Turhal as a fortress in the north of another ancient city named Gayyura. In the 3rd century BCE, the region was occupied by the contingents of Alexander the Great's Macedonian army, but many insurrections had also taken place in this era as the Macedonian occupiers couldn't build up a total control on the region. After the collapse of Alexander's Empire (as Alexander died in 323 BCE), the region was taken over by the Pontus Kingdom founded on the Black Sea coast who later had to retreat in the face of emerging Roman power in the whole Anatolia. The Pontus Kings from the Mithridates descendance constructed an even more powerful fortress on a rocky hill in the center of the outer city whose remains are only two ruined towers and several tunnels today. The struggle between the two powers lasted for decades and ended up in an absolute defeat suffered by the Pontus Kingdom. Having captured the fortress, the Roman General Pompeius destroyed it. In 395, The Roman Empire was divided into two independent states and thus, Turhal became a Byzantine domain together with other eastern Roman provinces. Turhal was the site of the bishopric of Ibora which persists as a titular see of the Roman Catholic Church to this day. During the Byzantine era, the region had undergone several raids from the Sassanids in the 4th and 5th centuries, later from the Muslim Arabs in the 8th century. As the constant Turkish immigration to Anatolia and the emerging Seljuk power in the neighbouring east weakened the Byzantine rule in the region, the Turkish principality of Danishmend captured Turhal and its environs in 1068 but later ceded it to the Kingdom of Seljuk Turks (Selçuklular). In the 13th century, the whole region was invaded by the Ilkhan Emperors who extended their rule as a devastating wave from the Middle Asia to Anatolia. In 1399, Turhal was taken over by the Ottomans who were uniting the Turkish principalities in Anatolia under their command. After a short invasion by Temur, Turhal was taken over once more by the Ottomans in 1413. The most significant change in the demographic structure of Turhal occurred during the second half of the 19th century as the town became a place of settlement for the Muslim refugees and immigrants coming from the Balkans and Caucasus due to constant military conflicts that the collapsing Ottomans got involved around those regions such as the Crimean War (1854–1878) and the Russo-Turkish War, 1877–1878. As mentioned above, Turhal is best known for its sugar beet processing plant established in 1934. But today Turhal's economy depends on much diverted business sectors such as textile, animal feed and dairy products. Turhal also has a machine works which provides an important income to the town. Today, Turhal is becoming important with its natural marble deposits and marble processing industries. Traditionally, stockbreeding and other agricultural activities still keep their importance too. According to the census taken in 1997, the total population of Turhal is more than 115,000 and is still on the increase.\", 'Perrott is a surname.

Without even waiting for the results of his exams (he would learn in Bombay that he had obtained his Licence in Letters and Law), he left Switzerland in June 1953 with his friend Thierry Vernet in a Fiat Topolino. First destination: Yugoslavia. The voyage lasted till December 1954. The voyage led the two men to Turkey, to Iran and to Pakistan, Thierry Vernet leaving his friend at the Khyber Pass. Bouvier continued alone. Bouvier recounted the journey in L\\'Usage du monde, published in English translation as \"The Way of the World\".[1] The pilgrim finds the words to express himself, and his feet follow them faithfully: \"A journey does not need reasons. Before long, it proves to be reason enough in itself. One thinks that one is going to make a journey, yet soon it is the journey that makes or unmakes you.\" The book was described as a voyage of self-discovery \\'\"on the order of Robert M. Pirsig’s Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\". With intermittent company, Bouvier crossed Afghanistan, Pakistan and India before reaching Ceylon. Here he lost his footing: the solitude and the heat floored him. It took him seven months to leave the island and almost thirty years to free himself of the weight of this adventure with the writing of Le Poisson-scorpion (published 1981, translated into English as The Scorpion-Fish). It ends on a quote from Louis-Ferdinand Céline: \"The worst defeat of all is to forget and especially the thing that has defeated you.\" After Ceylon, he left for another island: Japan. He found a country in the throes of change and he continued to visit Japan over the subsequent decades. These experiences led to Japon, which would become Chroniques Japonaises after a third sojourn in 1970 and a complete re-edition. It was published in English in 1992 as The Japanese Chronicles. In this book, he blended his personal experiences of Japan with Japanese history and rewrote a Japanese history from a Western perspectives. \"Japan,\" he says, \"is a lesson in economy. It is not considered good form to take up too much space.\" Building on a report for a journal in the Aran Islands, Bouvier wrote Journal d\\'Aran et d\\'autres lieux, a tale of travel that slips at times into the supernatural, the voyager suffering from typhoid. His appreciation of the air of the Irish islands is described as that which \"dilates, tonifies, intoxicates, lightens, frees up animal spirits in the head who give themselves over to unknown but amusing games. It brings together the virtues of champagne, cocaine, caffeine, amorous rapture and the tourism office makes a big mistake in forgetting it in its prospectuses.\"', \"The Commission municipale du Québec (English: Quebec Municipal Commission) is a quasi-judicial body that oversees municipal matters in the Canadian province of Quebec.

Shia Muslims, the other main branch of Islam, are not numerous in Turkmenistan, and the Shia religious practices of the Azerbaijani and Kurdish minorities are not politicized. The great majority of Turkmen readily identify themselves as Muslims and acknowledge Islam as an integral part of their cultural heritage, but some support a revival of the religion\\'s status primarily as an element of national revival.   Islam was introduced to Turkmenistan during the period of Islamic conquest by the second and third Rashidun Caliphs, Umar and Uthman. Integrated within the Turkmen tribal structure is the \"holy\" tribe called övlat. Ethnographers consider the övlat, of which six are active, as a revitalized form of the ancestor cult injected with Sufism. According to their genealogies, each tribe descends from the Prophet Muhammad through one of the Four Caliphs. Because of their belief in the sacred origin and spiritual powers of the övlat representatives, Turkmen accord these tribes a special, holy status. In the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the övlat tribes became dispersed in small, compact groups in Turkmenistan. They attended and conferred blessings on all important communal and life-cycle events, and also acted as mediators between clans and tribes. The institution of the övlat retains some authority today. Many of the Turkmen who are revered for their spiritual powers trace their lineage to an övlat, and it is not uncommon, especially in rural areas, for such individuals to be present at life-cycle and other communal celebrations.[2] In the Soviet era, all religious beliefs were attacked by the communist authorities as superstition and \"vestiges of the past.\" Most religious schooling and religious observance were banned, and the vast majority of mosques were closed. An official Muslim Board of Central Asia with headquarters in Tashkent was established during World War II to supervise Islam in Central Asia. For the most part, the Muslim Board functioned as an instrument of propaganda whose activities did little to enhance the Muslim cause. Atheist indoctrination stifled religious development and contributed to the isolation of the Turkmen from the international Muslim community. Some religious customs, such as Muslim burial and male circumcision, continued to be practiced throughout the Soviet period, but most religious belief, knowledge, and customs were preserved only in rural areas in \"folk form\" as a kind of unofficial Islam not sanctioned by the state-run Spiritual Directorate.[2] The current government oversees official Islam through a structure inherited from the Soviet period. Turkmenistan\\'s Muslim Religious Board, together with that of Uzbekistan, constitutes the Muslim Religious Board of Mavarannahr. The Mavarannahr board is based in Tashkent and exerts considerable influence in appointments of religious leaders in Turkmenistan. The governing body of Islamic judges (Kaziat) is registered with the Turkmenistan Ministry of Justice, and a council of religious affairs under the Cabinet of Ministers monitors the activities of clergy. Individuals who wish to become members of the official clergy must attend official religious institutions; a few, however, may prove their qualifications simply by taking an examination.[2] Many Turkmen do not regularly attend mosque services or demonstrate their adherence publicly, except through participation in officially sanctioned national traditions associated with Islam on a popular level, including life-cycle events such as weddings, burials, and pilgrimages.[2] However, since 1990, efforts have been made to regain some of the cultural heritage lost under Soviet rule. President Saparmurat Niyazov has ordered that basic Islamic principles be taught in public schools. More religious institutions, including religious schools and mosques, have appeared, many with the support of Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Turkey. Religious classes are held in both schools and mosques, with instruction in Arabic language, the Qur\\'an and the hadith, and history of Islam.[2] Turkmenistan\\'s government stresses its secular nature and its support of freedom of religious belief, as embodied in the 1991 Law on Freedom of Conscience and on Religious Organizations in the Turkmen Soviet Socialist Republic and institutionalized in the 1992 constitution. That document guarantees the separation of church and state; it also removes any legal basis for Islam to play a role in political life by prohibiting proselytizing, the dissemination of \"unofficial\" religious literature, discrimination based on religion, and the formation of religious political parties. In addition, the government reserves the right to appoint and dismiss anyone who teaches religious matters or who is a member of the clergy. Since independence, the Islamic leadership in Turkmenistan has been more assertive, but in large part it still responds to government control. The official governing body of religious judges gave its official support to President Niyazov in the June 1992 elections.[2] On the other hand, some Muslim leaders are opposed to the secular concept of government and especially to a government controlled by former communists (see Centers of Political Power, this ch.). Some official leaders and teachers working outside the official structure have vowed to increase the population\\'s knowledge of Islam, increase Islam\\'s role in society, and broaden adherence to its tenets. Alarmed that such activism may alienate Orthodox Slavs, the government has drawn up plans to elevate the council of religious affairs to ministry status in an effort to regulate religious activities more tightly.[2]', 'Terranova da Sibari is a town and comune in the province of Cosenza in the Calabria region of southern Italy.

It tells of a curse that fell upon the warrior Cú Chulainn as a result of his attacking otherworldly women, and his eventual recovery by reluctantly agreeing to give military aid to those he had wronged. His developing relationship with one of the Otherworldly women, Fand, occasions his wife Emer\\'s \"only jealousy.\"[1]   In the assessment of Myles Dillon, The story survives in two manuscripts, the twelfth-century Book of the Dun Cow and a seventeenth-century copy of this manuscript, Trinity College, Dublin, H. 4. 22.[3] It is clear, however, that the Book of the Dun Cow combined two different versions of the text: parts are in the hand of the main scribe of the manuscript (referred to by Dillon as Recension A), but parts have been erased and rewritten, or leaves removed and replaced, by a scribe with a different hand, apparently copying from a now lost manuscript known as the Yellow Book of Slane (referred to by Dillon as Recension B). This scribe may have made further additions of his own. Precisely how much of our surviving text belongs to each source has been the subject of debate. The material judged to derive from Recension B exhibits linguistic features pointing, amongst later ones, to the ninth century, while the language of A seems to be eleventh-century.[4] A has long been considered the more conservative version of the story nevertheless, but John Carey has argued that B is the earlier version.[5] The combination of material leads to some inconsistencies and incoherence in the story, prominently an apparent shift from calling Cú Chulainn\\'s wife Ethne Ingubai to calling her Emer. The Ulster hero Cú Chulainn is with other men in Muirtheimne, hunting birds by the water. A number of the men kill two birds for their wives, so the women may wear feathers on each shoulder of their gowns. When all the women but Emer have birds, Cú Chulainn becomes determined to kill the largest, most beautiful birds for her. The only birds still in the sky are indeed the largest and most exotic-looking, but the two seabirds are linked by a golden chain and sing a magical sleeping song. Emer recognizes that this means they are from the Otherworld and tells Cú Chulainn not to kill them. He attempts to do so anyway, but only manages to strike one of the birds on the feathers of her wing, damaging her wing, but not inflicting a mortal wound. Cú Chulainn falls ill, and lies unconscious and feverish next to a standing stone.[1] In his fevered state he sees two women approaching. They are Fand and Lí Ban, whom he assaulted while they were in bird form. They have horsewhips and beat him almost to death. He lies ill in bed for nearly a year, until Lí Ban returns, asking him to come to Mag Mell and help Fand defeat her enemies in a battle there. In exchange for his military aid, Fand will agree to heal him of his illness. Cú Chulainn refuses, but his charioteer, Láeg, agrees to go. At this point, the story is interrupted by Cú Chulainn suddenly giving a long series of advice to his foster-son Lugaid Réoderg, the newly chosen king of Tara. This material is part of the genre of tecosca (\\'precepts, instructions\\') and, in Dillon\\'s estimation, \\'can hardly belong to the story in its original form\\'.[6] However, Cú Chulainn\\'s uncharacteristic wisdom here can be understood as a beneficial side-effect of his magically inflicted illness.[7] On his return, Láeg, with the help of Emer (who berates her husband for choosing his pride over his health) manages to convince Cú Chulainn to accompany him to Fand\\'s lands.[1] In Mag Mell he joins the battle, and helps defeat Fand and Lí Ban\\'s enemies. Fand agrees to sleep with him, but this is discovered by Emer, who confronts Fand, accompanied by a troop of women armed with knives. After much discussion both women recognize the other\\'s unselfish love, and request that Cú Chulainn take the other. Fand decides that since she already has a husband, Manannán mac Lir, Emer should stay with Cú Chulainn so she will not be left alone. Cú Chulainn and Fand are both heartbroken, however. Fand asks Manannán to shake his cloak of mist between her and Cú Chulainn, ensuring that they will never meet again. The druids give Cúchulainn and Emer a potion of forgetfulness, and they forget the entire affair.[1] The text closes with a statement generally attributed to scribe who altered the manuscript text (sometimes omitted from translations), that \\'that is the disastrous vision shown to Cú Chulainn by the fairies. For the diabolical power was great before the faith, and it was so great that devils used to fight with men in bodily form, and used to show delights and mysteries to them, as though they really existed. So they were believed to be; and ignorant men used to call those visions síde and áes síde\\'.[8] Augusta, Lady Gregory included a Victorian version of the story in her 1902 collection Cuchulain of Muirthemne.

In December 1917, the Centerville Ward was divided into the Centerville 1st and Centerville 2nd Wards.[8] In 1930, the two Centerville Wards had a combined membership of 823.[9] Today, there are four stakes of the LDS Church in Centerville.[10] The Episcopal Church of the Resurrection (ECOR) also resides in Centerville on 1131 S. Main Street. Originally organized in 1963 as a mission of the Cathedral Church of St. Mark to serve the Episcopalians in the southern part of Davis County, Utah, ECOR’s first services were held in the Bountiful Jeep Posse Clubhouse. Parish records indicate that there were approximately 50 members at that time.[11] Around 1967, the Very Reverend Wesley Frensdorff, Dean of St. Mark’s, and the Reverend Donald Mills facilitated the use of the Bountiful Community Church (BCC) for worship. As a result, ECOR began using the small Danforth Chapel at BCC for the next 25 years. The two congregations shared facilities, budget, committees, programs, church school, and one service each month. Problems, however, developed between the congregations and in 1993, ECOR separated from Bountiful Community Church to locate in an empty bank building in Centerville.[11] In 2000, Project Jubilee—an expansion effort funded by the Episcopal Diocese of Utah—purchased land for a new church building just south of the bank. Ground breaking for the new church took place in March 2001. The first service was held on Easter, 2002 and Bishop Carolyn Tanner Irish dedicated the building on May 18, 2002. Today, the church hosts Sunday service with Holy Eucharist weekly at 10:00 AM. The Reverend Lyn Zill Briggs currently presides as rector and priest of the congregation.[11] The Centerville City Youth Council is a service & political based organization, sponsored and funded by Centerville City. It is the sponsor of many youth activities including the annual Halloween Pumpkin Walk, Christmas Coloring Contest, Easter Egg Hunt, and recently, a Teen Movie Night. Politically, the youth council\\'s objective is to represent the youth of Centerville City with the Youth Mayor acting as the liaison to the City Council. Recently, the youth council has been in the planning and implementation process of a new recycling program now operating successfully throughout the city. The Youth Council is currently set up with a Youth Mayor and Council between the ages of 14 and 18. Each member serves a term of 2 years that can be renewed. For current Youth Council information visit the Youth Council Website[12] As of the census[2] of 2000, there were 14,585 people, 4,138 households, and 3,546 families residing in the city. The population density was 2,415.8 people per square mile (932.3/km²). There were 4,280 housing units at an average density of 708.9 per square mile (273.6/km²). The racial makeup of the city was 97.06% White, 0.23% African American, 0.16% Native American, 0.75% Asian, 0.23% Pacific Islander, 0.60% from other races, and 0.97% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 1.95% of the population. There were 4,138 households out of which 51.5% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 76.1% were married couples living together, 7.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 14.3% were non-families. 12.3% of all households were made up of individuals and 4.8% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 3.52 and the average family size was 3.88. The population was spread out with 35.9% under the age of 18, 11.5% from 18 to 24, 25.2% from 25 to 44, 20.4% from 45 to 64, and 7.0% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 27 years. For every 100 females there were 99.0 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 94.6 males. The median income for a household in the city was $64,818, and the median income for a family was $70,855. Males had a median income of $50,033 versus $26,527 for females. The per capita income for the city was $19,666. About 1.4% of families and 2.0% of the population were below the poverty line, including 2.2% of those under age 18 and 1.7% of those age 65 or over. Centerville maintains five public schools in the city. The nearest high school is Viewmont High School, located south of Centerville in the city of Bountiful. * Each site is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

It is found in shallow seas in tropical parts of the central Indo-Pacific region.   Colochirus robustus is roughly cylindrical with 5 shallow longitudinal ribs and grows to about 7 centimetres (2.8\\xa0in) in length. It has an angular appearance and finger-like or thorn-like protuberances on the ribs. At the anterior end is a ring of about eight large, feathery feeding tentacles. There is a slight transverse indentation near the rounded posterior end. There are three rows of tube feet on the underside. The colour is a vivid yellow, sometimes with grey between the ridges. Colochirus robustus is found in the tropical waters of the central Indo-Pacific region at depths down to about 25 metres (82\\xa0ft). Its range includes the Philippines and Indonesia.[2] Colochirus robustus is usually found on rocks and reefs in places with moderate to rapid water flow. It clings to the substrate with its tube feet, spreading its feathery tentacles to catch zooplankton and other organic particles as they float past. The tentacles are then retracted to the mouth where the food particles are scraped off.[3] Colochirus robustus can reproduce both sexually and asexually. In the latter case, fission can take place with a transverse crack developing halfway along the body and gradually widening until the two halves split apart. The posterior end then grows a new anus while the anterior end develops a mouth and new tentacles.[4] Colochirus robustus is sometimes kept in reef aquaria because of its distinctive appearance. It is only recommended for experts however as it may release toxins into the water if stressed and has specialised feeding requirements.[5]', 'Umesh Damdor Valjee, MBE (born 30 September 1969 in Durban, KwaZulu-Natal) is a South African-born English deaf cricketer.[1][2] Valjee is a captain of the deaf cricket team of England, and was awarded with the England Disability Cricketer of the Year in 2011.[3] He is a right-handed batsman and occasional right-arm medium pacer.[4] Valjee came into professional cricket after being signed to British Deaf Sports Council in 1989. He is the longest-serving deaf cricketer of England, and wear same number shirt (No. 1) as was worn by Tom Armitage—the first capped England player.[5]', \"Séamus Looney (born 1950 in Cork, Ireland) is an Irish former sportsperson. A dual player at the highest levels, he played hurling and Gaelic football with his local club St. Finbarr's and was a member of the Cork senior inter-county teams in both codes from 1969 until 1977.[1]   Looney first came to prominence as a dual player at minor level with Cork. He first tasted success with the Cork Gaelic footballers who won both Munster and All-Ireland honours in 1967. This feat was repeated in 1968 with Looney playing a key role on the full-back line as he captured another pair of provincial and All-Ireland medals. 1968 also saw Looney come to the fore with the county’s minor hurling team, as he won a Munster title but lost out on an All-Ireland medal. Looney subsequently moved on to the under-21 grades in both hurling and football. It was the beginning of a hugely successful period for the county. In 1969 Looney won his first set of Munster and All-Ireland under-21 hurling titles. He also captured a Munster under-21 football title for good measure. 1970 saw the success continue with Looney winning a second consecutive set of provincial and All-Ireland medals in hurling. That year he also added both Munster and All-Ireland under-21 football medals to his ever-growing collection of honours. In 1971 Looney completed a famous three-in-a-row with the under-21 hurlers when they captured the Munster and All-Ireland titles for a third successive year. Not to be outdone the Cork under-21 footballers also retained their Munster and All-Ireland honours, making it two-in-a-row. By 1970 Looney was a key player on the Cork senior hurling team. He began that year by winning his first National Hurling League title, before later collecting his very first senior Munster title. Cork later beat Wexford in the first 80-minute championship decider, giving Looney his first All-Ireland medal. By 1971 Looney was also lining out for the county’s senior football team. He won a Munster title that year, however, the team was knocked out in the All-Ireland semi-final. 1972 saw Looney add a second National Hurling League medal to his collection, as well as a second Munster hurling title. Cork were later defeated by Kilkenny in a thrilling All-Ireland final. Partial Reference: Cork GAA website Inter-County SHC Results and Teams. 1960-1969 Information from Peter Devine.

Since the 2011 local government reform it is part of the municipality Gortynia, of which it is the seat and a municipal unit.[2] The municipal unit has an area of 110.759\\xa0km2.[3] Dimitsana is built on the ruins of the ancient town Teuthis. The population of the village is 342 (2011 census), while it was 611 in 2001. It has been registered as a traditional settlement. Dimitsana is built on a mountain slope at an elevation of 950 meters. From its southern side a marvelous view of Megalopolis plain and Taygetus is provided. Dimitsana is located 53\\xa0km east of Pyrgos, 31\\xa0km northwest of Tripoli, 23\\xa0km northwest of Megalopoli and 17\\xa0km northeast of Andritsaina. The village has a school, a historical library, several churches, a post office, an open-air water-power museum,[4] an open amphitheater, hotels and a square.   At the site of present-day Dimitsana there was, in ancient times, the ancient Arcadian town Teuthis that had participated in the Trojan War, but also in the colonization of Megalopolis. In 963 Philosophou Monastery was founded 2,5\\xa0km from Dimitsana. The name of the town is first recorded in 967 in a Patriarchate\\'s document related to Philosophou Monastery. The first gunpowder mills of the town were built under the guise of home industry in the middle of the 18th century by Bishop Ananias Lakedaimonias, who paved a revolt against the Turks. In 1764 the movement was revealed and Ananias and his partners were killed. In the same year Agapios, a wise monk, built a library, where he moved the books of the monastery. The library was growing up constantly until 1821, as the Patriarchate offered new books and there was operating a seminary, known as Φροντιστήριο Ελληνικών Γραμμάτων (Tuitin Centre of Greek Literature). A lot of bishops and scholars graduated from it, among them Patriarch Gregory V of Constantinople and Germanos III of Old Patras whose houses have survived in the town. After the Orlov events, some inhabitants of Dimitsana bearing the name \"Tasoulis\" (Greek: Τασούλης) migrated to Minor Asia fleeing the Albanian ravaging of Peloponnese.[5] Upon arrival in Koldere, in 1777, near Magnesia (ad Sipylum), they changed their name \"Tasopoulos\" (Greek: Τασόπουλος).[6] Ιn the Greek War of Independence Dimitsana played an important role with its gunpowder mills, but during the war a large part of its library\\'s books were destroyed, as Greek warriors used their paper in the 14 gunpowder mills, that worked day and night, supplying them with gunpowder. For this reason Dimitsana has been called \"the Nation\\'s powder keg\". In 1960 Dimitsana\\'s population was about 2,000, but a lot of people have since then immigrated to the United States, Australia and elsewhere. Dimitsana is a stone-built village with remarkable mansions, most of which are now restored. It is a typical sample of Gortynia\\'s architecture and it is registered as a traditional one. The statue of Patriarch Gregory V dominates in the central square and also the family houses of both him and Germanos III of Old Patras can be seen. Dimitsana\\'s Library contains today about 35,000 books, manuscripts and documents. In Dimitsana\\'s Museum, housed in the Library, there are collections of weaving, looms and handicrafts and an archaeological one. The Elementary School was built 1898–1910, by a donation of Andreas Syngros, and is a characteristic sample of that period. It operated as a girls\\' school until 1930 and later as county court. Not far from the village is the Open-air Water Power Museum (1997), created by restoration of abandoned pre-industrial facilities, based on the Water Power. It includes a flourmill, a traditional cauldron, a tannery, a tanner\\'s house and a gunpowder mill. In the surroundings important sights include the Old and the New Philosophou Monastery and Prodromou Monastery, both located inside Loussios\\'s gorge. The municipal unit Dimitsana is subdivided into the following communities (constituent villages in brackets): House in Dimitsana. The statue of Gregory V in Dimitsana. Old Houses Snapshot Street in Dimitsana', 'Eburodacrys obscura is a species of beetle in the family Cerambycidae. It was described by Martins in 1973.[1] ', 'The Ducrot SLD was an Italian fighter prototype built by Ducrot in 1918.   During the latter half of World War I, Ing Manlio Stiavelli and Guido Luzzatti of the firm of Vittorio Ducrot at Palermo designed a high-performance fighter in an attempt to allow the company to progress from license production of flying boats designed elsewhere to producer of originally designed aircraft. Emphasizing aerodynamic cleanliness, they designed the SLD (for \"Stiavelli-Luzzatti-Ducrot\"), a single-seat biplane fighter powered by the 149-kilowatt (200-horsepower) Hispano-Suiza 35 engine driving a two-bladed propeller. It had a plywood monocoque fuselage of oval section. The undercarriage struts extended through the lower wing to carry the fuselage above the lower wing.[1] Testing of the SLD began in October 1918, but its results have been lost. No production order from the Corpo Aeronautico Militare (Italian Royal Air Force) ensued, and only one prototype was built.[1] Data from The Complete Book of Fighters[1] General characteristics Performance', 'William Harvey Maddren was an American lacrosse coach and physician. He served as the fourth head coach of the Johns Hopkins University lacrosse team from 1897 to 1901 during which time his teams compiled a 25–6 record and captured three national championships. The son of a doctor, Maddren was a native of Brooklyn, New York.[1] He attended Brooklyn Polytechnic Institute, from which he received a Bachelor of Science degree in 1896.[1] Maddren then studied medicine at Johns Hopkins University and received a medical doctorate in 1901.[1] Maddren played lacrosse at Hopkins from 1897 to 1901, and in his first year there, was elected team captain and appointed as its player-coach.[1] The Intercollegiate Lacrosse Association awarded Hopkins the national championship each year from 1898 to 1900.[2] In May 1904, Maddren returned to Baltimore to attend a medical clinic at Johns Hopkins Hospital, and while there, also served as an assistant coach to Charles MacInnes for the game against Swarthmore College.[3] Alexander M. Weyand and Milton R. Roberts wrote in The Lacrosse Story that Maddren\\'s efforts were largely responsible for \"convert[ing] sedate Baltimore into a seething hotbed of lacrosse enthusiasm, the like of which had never been seen elsewhere in the United States.\"[1] Maddren died on January 8, 1909.[4] The National Lacrosse Hall of Fame inducted him in 1961.[1]', 'Gęsikowo [ɡɛ̃ɕiˈkɔvɔ] is a settlement in the administrative district of Gmina Biskupiec, within Olsztyn County, Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship, in northern Poland.[1] Before 1945 the area was part of Germany (East Prussia).

The high-performance computing cluster is operated by Information Technology at Purdue (ITaP), the university\\'s central information technology organization. ITaP also operates clusters named Coates built in 2009, Rossmann built in 2010, and Hansen and Carter built in 2011. Steele was the largest campus supercomputer in the Big Ten outside a national center when built. It ranked 104th on the November 2008 TOP500 Supercomputer Sites list.   Steele consisted of 893 64-bit, 8-core Dell PowerEdge 1950 and nine 64-bit, 8-core Dell PowerEdge 2950 systems with various combinations of 16-32 gigabytes RAM, 160 GB to 2 terabytes of disk, and Gigabit Ethernet and SDR InfiniBand to each node. The cluster had a theoretical peak performance of more than 60 teraflops. Steele and its 7,216 cores replaced the Purdue Lear cluster supercomputer which had 1,024 cores but was substantially slower. Steele is primarily networked utilizing a Foundry Networks BigIron RX-16 switch with a Tyco MRJ-21 wiring system delivering over 900 Gigabit Ethernet connections and eight 10 Gigabit Ethernet uplinks. Steele nodes ran Red Hat Enterprise Linux starting with release 4.0[1] and used Portable Batch System Professional 10.4.6 (PBSPro 10.4.6) for resource and job management. The cluster also had compilers and scientific programming libraries installed. The first 812 nodes of Steele were installed in four hours on May 5, 2008,[2] by a team of 200 Purdue computer technicians and volunteers, including volunteers from in-state athletic rival Indiana University. The staff had made a video titled \"Installation Day\" as a parody of the film Independence Day.[3] The cluster ran 1,400 science and engineering jobs by lunchtime.[4][5] In 2010, Steele was moved to an HP Performance Optimized Datacenter, a self-contained, modular, shipping container-style unit installed on campus in order to make room for new clusters in Purdue\\'s main research computing data center.[6][7][8][9] The Steele supercomputer and Purdue\\'s other clusters were part of the Purdue Community Cluster Program, a partnership between ITaP and Purdue faculty. In Purdue\\'s program, a \"community\" cluster is funded by hardware money from grants, faculty startup packages, institutional funds and other sources. ITaP\\'s Rosen Center for Advanced Computing administers the community clusters and provides user support. Each faculty partner always has ready access to the capacity he or she purchases and potentially to more computing power when the nodes of other partners are idle. Unused, or opportunistic, cycles from Steele are made available to the National Science Foundation\\'s TeraGrid (now XESEDE) system and the Open Science Grid using Condor software. A portion of Steele also was dedicated directly to TeraGrid use. Steele users came fields such as aeronautics and astronautics, agriculture, biology, chemistry, computer and information technology, earth and atmospheric sciences, mathematics, pharmacology, statistics, and electrical, materials and mechanical engineering. The cluster was used to design new drugs and materials, to model weather patterns and the effects of global warming, and to engineer future aircraft and nano electronics. Steele also served the Compact Muon Solenoid Tier 2 Center at Purdue, one of the particle physics experiments conducted with the Large Hadron Collider. Unused, or opportunistic, cycles from Steele were made available to the TeraGrid and the Open Science Grid using Condor software. Steele was part of Purdue\\'s distributed computing Condor flock, and the center of DiaGrid, a nearly 43,000-processor Condor-powered distributed computing network for research involving Purdue and partners at nine other campuses. The Steele cluster is named for John M. Steele, Purdue associate professor emeritus of computer science, who was involved with research computing at Purdue almost from its inception. He joined the Purdue staff in 1963 at the Computer Sciences Center associated with the then-new Computer Science Department. He served as the director of the Purdue University Computing Center, the high-performance computing unit at Purdue prior to the Rosen Center for Advanced Computing, from 1988 to 2001 before retiring in 2003. His research interests have been in the areas of computer data communications and computer circuits and systems, including research on an early mobile wireless Internet system.[10]', 'Arthur William Bassett Sclater (27 July 1859 – 16 June 1882) was an Irish-born English cricketer. Sclater was a right-handed batsman who bowled right-arm medium pace. He was born at Auburn, County Cavan, and was educated at Tunbridge Wells, Kent, and the Royal Agricultural College, Cirencester.[1] Described as a \"young man of grand physique\" who stood at \"6 feet 5 inches without boots, and proportionately well made\", Sclater made his first-class debut for Sussex against Surrey in 1879 at the County Ground, Hove. He made eight further first-class appearances for the county, all in 1880, the last of which came against Hampshire at the Antelope Ground, Southampton.[2] In his nine matches, he scored 107 runs at an average of 11.88, with a high score of 18 not out.[3] With the ball, he took a 35 wickets at a bowling average of 19.62, with best figures of 7/45.[4] This was his only five-wicket haul and came against Surrey at The Oval in 1880, in a match in which he finished with match figures of 10/92.[5] He later emigrated to New Zealand aboard the SS Manapouri, where he moved in with his cousin, a Mr. E. S. Vernon, who owned a large estate along the Titirau River near Fortrose.[1] On 16 June 1882, Sclater went to shoot ducks on the river, in the company of Miss Josephine Rich, who also lived on the estate of Mr. Vernon. Around noon she departed to make her way back to the house, with Sclater telling her he would follow her home later. The banks of the river were covered in thick undergrowth, and while making his way through it, his breech-loaded gun caught a twig, causing the gun to discharge. The resulting shot hit him in the forehead toward his left eye, the result of which killed him.[1] His body was found the next day in the river by Mr. W. G. Rich and his son.[1] A jury later returned a verdict of accidental death.[1]', 'Hexacyclonate (Gevilon) is a stimulant drug. It has been used for the treatment of alcoholism[1] and for increasing motivation in elderly patients,[2] but is now mainly used for the treatment of hyperlipoproteinaemia. [3][4] It is chemically similar to the anticonvulsant gabapentin, with a hydroxyl group replacing the amine. The latter use may be incorrectly assigned, as \"Gevilon\" has been used as a trade name for gemfibrozil, a well-known drug for dislypidemia.

In Europe the small adult moths (genera Antispila and Heliozela) are seldom noticed as they fly quite early in the spring. The larvae are leaf miners [2] and the vacated leaf mines are distinctive because the larva leaves a large hole at the end. The family is worldwide but the recently discovered genus Plesiozela from southern South America (which has five segments in the labial palps) may represent the sister group of living heliozelids (Karsholt and Kristensen, 2003).', 'A needlegun, also known as a needler, flechette gun or fletcher, is a firearm that fires small, sometimes fin-stabilized, metal darts or flechettes.   The first projectiles in early gun systems dating from the 14th century were typically hand wrought iron flechettes wrapped in a leather sabot. However, due to the expense and trouble of making these darts in a pre-industrial society, they were soon replaced with the less accurate stone cannonball. Flechettes again came into mass use in the years before World War I. Starting as early as 1910, the French began experimenting with air-dropped flechettes; flechettes dropped from planes were used extensively during the war.[1] A June 1978 issue of Gallery Magazine[2] quotes L. Fletcher Prouty observing a test of flechette weapons in 1960 and the testimony of William E. Colby in the Church Committee on September 16 to 18, 1975 describing flechette weapons. Charles A. Senseney testified that he was a project engineer of the M-1 dart launcher that was described as resembling a M1911 pistol with a sight mount at the top. Senseney claimed the M-1 was designed for the US Army Special Forces to be used in the Vietnam war but never got there due to not being able to get into the US Army\\'s logistics system in time.[3] Flechette ammunition encased in a sabot was available for the M-16, shotguns, and other weapons for use in Vietnam. A June 1965 Esquire magazine story on the making of the then upcoming James Bond film Thunderball featured drawings of dart firing pistols that were not used in the completed film.[4] At the same time several makes of underwater firearms fired a steel bolt just over 4 inches long (but without fins). The Special Purpose Individual Weapon was a long-running United States Army program to develop, in part, a workable XM-216 flechette-based \"rifle\", though other concepts were also involved. The concepts continued to be tested under the Future Rifle Program and again in the 1980s and 1990s under the Advanced Combat Rifle program, but neither program resulted in a system useful enough to warrant replacing the current M16. Theoretically, the advantages of a needlegun over conventional projectile firearms are in its compact size, high rate of fire, and extreme muzzle velocity. A needlegun leverages the principles of kinetic energy and conservation of momentum, resulting in a low-recoil delivery system capable of inflicting significant damage to a soft target. Although it has extreme velocity, the needle possesses little mass, delivering the equivalent kinetic energy of a larger projectile, but with less recoil-causing momentum. There have been experiments to make guided flechettes that can home in on targets.[5]', 'The Hotchkiss School is a private, nonsectarian,[1][2] coeducational, college preparatory boarding school in Lakeville, Connecticut, founded in 1891. The school offers a classical education[5] with grades 9–12 and a postgraduate (PG) option, attracting students across the United States and 34 foreign countries.[3] Hotchkiss is a member of the Eight Schools Association,[12] Ten Schools Admissions Organization,[13] G20 Schools group, Founders League,[14] New England Preparatory School Athletic Council (NEPSAC),[15] New England Association of Schools and Colleges (NEASC),[16] The Association of Boarding Schools (TABS),[2] National Association of Independent Schools,[20] Global Education Benchmark Group (GEBG),[17] Round Square,[18] Cum Laude Society,[21] and Green Schools Alliance.[19] Hotchkiss has a highly competitive 18% admit rate (2013),[10] and one of the largest private school endowments in the country (ranked fifth largest in 2008 by New York Times).[22]   In 1891, Maria Harrison Bissell Hotchkiss, with guidance from Yale President Timothy Dwight V, founded the school to prepare young men for Yale University. In 1892, Hotchkiss opened its doors to 50 male boarding students for $600. Hotchkiss\\'s endowment also precipitated scholarship aid to deserving students. In 1974, the school became coeducational.[5] George Van Santvoord (g. 1908, Yale 1912),[23] a headmaster hailed as the Duke with an honorary dorm, claimed there was only one school rule: Be a gentleman.[24][25][26][27] In 1954, TIME recognized in Education: The Duke Steps Down, that \"of all U.S. prep schools, few, if any, can beat the standards Hotchkiss has set.\"[28] Maria Hotchkiss was uninterested in establishing \"a school for the pampered sons of rich gentlemen.\" The school has enrolled international students since 1896.[29] In 1928, the school joined the English-Speaking Union and established the International Schoolboy Exchange. Established by the Class of 1948, the Fund for Global Understanding enables student participation in summer service projects across the world.[5] In 1953, Hotchkiss alumnus Eugene Van Voorhis (g. 1951, Yale \\'55, Yale Law ‘58) incorporated the Ulysses S. Grant Foundation program to assist minority New Haven students with boarding school admission,[30] with Hotchkiss School formally participating in addition to other recruitment initiatives from the 1960s onward,[5] such as A Better Chance (ABC),[31] Greater Opportunity (GO) summer program for inner-city students,[32][33] and Prep for Prep to foster minority leaders.[5] The school has a 43% diverse student body[3] (21% international students),[5] offers a School Year Abroad program,[5] and is a member of the Global Education Benchmark Group (GEBG),[17] Round Square,[18] and Confucius Institute International Division (Hanban).[34] In 2010, Hotchkiss partnered with Peking University High School to establish its study abroad, international division called Dalton Academy.[35][36] Operating on a semester schedule, the Hotchkiss School offers a classical education,[5] 224 courses, 7 foreign languages (Chinese, French, German, Greek, Latin, Russian and Spanish),[3] and study abroad programs.[37] In 1991, the New York Times recognized Hotchkiss\\' summer program as, \"Summer School for the Very Ambitious\"[38] and in 2011, as a private school leader in the farm-to-table movement,[39] by incorporating agriculture into the curriculum since 2008.[40] The year prior, the Deerfield Scroll featured that \"many consider the Hotchkiss School to be the leader in environmental awareness among the top prep schools in the country.\"[41] The school has a 100% college matriculation rate,[3] and among the Classes of 2011-14, 33 enrolled at Yale, 19 at Harvard, and 16 at Princeton.[42] In 2007, the Wall Street Journal listed Hotchkiss as among the schools with a higher success rate (than Choate and Deerfield) in matriculation at Harvard, Princeton and six others (excluding Yale).[43] Hotchkiss fields 19 interscholastic sports teams[3] that compete in the Founders League,[14] Eight Schools Athletic Council,[12] New England Preparatory School Athletic Council (NEPSAC),[16] and Interscholastic Sailing Association\\'s New England Schools Sailing Association (NESSA) district.[44] Its colors are Yale Blue and white, with the mascot being the bearcat.[6] In 1933, Samuel Gottscho photographed the Hotchkiss baseball team, which appears in the Library of Congress\\' Gottscho-Schleisner Collection.[45] NEPSAC New England Class A Champion – 2014, 2011, 2010, 2009, 2008, 2007, 2006, 2005, 2004, 2003, 2002, 1998 NEPSAC New England Class A Champion – 2008 Despite Kent School\\'s location in the same county, the Hotchkiss School and Taft School have a long-standing rivalry, where on the final Saturday of the fall sport season, called Taft Day at Hotchkiss and Hotchkiss Day at Taft, the two schools compete against each other in every sport.[5][7] Similar boarding school traditions include the Andover–Exeter rivalry and Choate–Deerfield rivalry. Hotchkiss offer over 65 clubs, including The Record, a biweekly, student-run newspaper circulated on campus and among alumni, The Mischianza yearbook, the Hotchkiss Chorus music ensemble, and extensive service organizations. The school also hosts an annual student-run film festival, The Hotchkiss Film Festival, that attracts student filmmakers from all over the world to compete for prizes and a scholarship. [9] [48] The school overlooks the Berkshires (named among the 200 Last Great Places by The Nature Conservancy)[49][50] on a rural, 827 acres (3\\xa0km2) campus featuring 13 single-sex dorms (Baechle-Ayres, Buehler, Coy, Dana, Edelman, Flinn, Garland, Larsen House, Memorial, Tinker, Van Santvoord, Watson, Wieler and Redlich, opened in 2016),[51] 2 lakes, and 1 forest.[3] The Main Building serves as the academic and social center, featuring 30 SmartBoard classrooms, the Edsel Ford Memorial Library with 87,000-volumes occupying 25,000 square feet, and dining halls.[52] An EPA Green Power Partner[53] and Green Schools Ally,[19] Hotchkiss requires all campus buildings to acquire LEED certification[54] and was renovated to achieve the second highest, LEED Gold certification in 2008[55] and use 34% green power[53] (ranked eighth largest, green K–12 school in 2009 by EPA),[56] while upholding the Georgian architecture tradition from Bruce Price, Cass Gilbert, and Delano and Aldrich.[49] The school renovation project earned Robert A.M. Stern Architects the 2010 Palladio Award, with Paul Rudolph[49] and Butler Rogers Basket[54] contributing elements of modern architecture. Beyond its increasingly visible role providing organically grown food for the School Dining Hall, the 270-acre Hotchkiss Farm is also where art classes can practice plein air painting, poetry classes can find inspiration, environmental science classes can explore terrain that includes rare grassland bird habitats, and American history classes can reflect on the fact that this was once part of a land grant from King George III. When completed, farm trails will add an estimated three to five miles to the six or more that already traverse the Hotchkiss Woods. In 2005, Hotchkiss opened the 715-seat Esther Eastman Music Center, equipped with a handmade Fazioli F308 piano, 12 Steinway pianos, 12 practice rooms, 3 ensemble practice rooms, a WKIS radio station and Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) lab. Hotchkiss also has a 615-seat proscenium theater called Walker Auditorium.[52] In 2002, Hotchkiss opened the Forrest E. Mars Jr. Athletic Center, a 212,000 square-foot athletic center with multi-purpose playing surfaces, elevated indoor exercise track, the Andrew K. Dwyer and Martin Dwyer III Olympic Rink and Thomas Schmidt NHL Rink, natatorium with 10-lane pool and separate diving well, William C. Fowle Gymnasium (hardwood basketball court), Edward R. Davis Wrestling Room, Joseph Cullman Squash Courts featuring eight international squash courts, Ford Indoor Tennis Courts, John R.

It is arguably his most famous short story and is the title story for his collection on the Franco-Prussian War, titled Boule de Suif et Autres Contes de la Guerre (Dumpling and Other Stories of the War).   The story is set in the Franco-Prussian War and follows a group of French residents of Rouen, recently occupied by the Prussian army. The ten travellers decide for various reasons, to leave Rouen and flee to Le Havre in a stagecoach. Sharing the carriage are Boule de Suif or \"Butterball\" (lit.suet dumpling, also translated as ball of fat), a prostitute whose real name is Elisabeth Rousset; the strict Democrat Cornudet; a shop-owning couple from the petty bourgeoisie, M. and Mme. Loiseau; a wealthy upper-bourgeoisie factory-owner and his wife, M. and Mme. Carré-Lamadon; the Comte and Comtesse of Bréville; and two nuns. Thus, the carriage constitutes a microcosm of French society, representing different parts of the French population during the late 19th century. Due to the terrible weather, the coach moves very slowly and by midday has only covered a few miles. The occupants initially snub Boule de Suif but their attitudes change when she produces a picnic basket full of lovely food and offers to share its contents with the hungry travellers. At the village of Tôtes, the carriage stops at the local coaching inn, and the occupants, hearing a German voice, realise they have blundered into Prussian-held territory. A Prussian officer detains the party at the inn indefinitely without telling them why. Over the next two days, the travellers become increasingly impatient, and are finally told by Boule de Suif that they are being detained until she agrees to sleep with the officer. She is repeatedly called before the officer, and always returns in a heightened state of agitation. Initially, the travellers support her and are furious at the officer\\'s arrogance, but their indignation soon disappears as they grow angry at Boule de Suif for not sleeping with the officer so that they can leave. Over the course of the next two days, the travelers use various examples of logic and morality to convince her it is the right thing to do; she finally gives in and sleeps with the officer, who allows them to leave the next morning. As they continue on their way to Le Havre, these \"representatives of Virtue\" ignore Boule de Suif and turn to polite topics of conversation, glancing scathingly at the young woman while refusing to even acknowledge her, and refusing to share their food with her the way that she did with them earlier. As the coach travels on into the night, Cornudet starts whistling the Marseillaise while Boule de Suif seethes with rage against the other passengers, and finally weeps for her lost dignity. The main theme focuses on French resistance to the German occupiers during the war. During the first half of the story, the narrator explains the background of each of the occupants, with particular emphasis on the petty bourgeois Democrat, Cornudet, who is said to have devised all manner of defences for Rouen. The overriding theme is that while the occupants talk a great deal about resisting the invaders, they are ultimately running away in a cowardly fashion rather than staying in the town. This first section of the story also establishes that the most fiercely patriotic passenger is Boule de Suif herself, an insignificant and unpopular character in Rouen, while the aristocrats and bourgeois are portrayed as happier to betray their country in order to end the war and return to their comfortable lives. In this respect, Maupassant praises the patriotic fervour of the inhabitants of the provinces, in sharp contrast to other French writers of the period who accused provincial French citizens of being apathetic and cowardly. Boule de Suif\\'s personal resistance grows throughout the story; when the coach is stopped by the Germans at the village of Tôtes, the other passengers meekly follow the officer\\'s orders while Boule de Suif refuses to co-operate as easily. Boule de Suif\\'s resistance to the officer\\'s sexual advances again shows her patriotism, something which is noticed by the other characters, who comment that although it is Boule de Suif\\'s job to sleep with men, she patriotically refuses to allow herself to be conquered by the German officer. Like Maupassant\\'s other short stories on the Franco-Prussian War, he tends to stereotype the German soldiers. The troops holding Rouen are hinted at as dull and slow-witted. The German officer at the inn is portrayed in the same way as Maupassant depicts German officers throughout his stories; the officer is shown as being arrogant, morally dubious, and unfeeling. The description of the officer in his room at the inn suggests that he is pointlessly destructive, uncultured, and boorish. At the same time, there are passages that describe how German troops get about their daily life and long to return home to their own families. The theme of class barrier is also tackled in the story. Throughout the story, Maupassant portrays the inhabitants of the coach in various disparaging ways. The aristocratic Comte and Comtesse are revealed to be weak and cowardly in spite of their position as the chief dignitaries of Rouen. The manufacturer and his wife are constantly portrayed as greedy and materialistic, and the manufacturer\\'s wife in particular is always shown to be shocked whenever her husband spends any money. The petit bourgeois wine-seller and his wife are shown as corrupt and morally reprehensible, the most likely of the party to betray their country simply to return to a life of greed in peace. The two nuns travelling in the coach are at first portrayed as quiet and subservient to God, and later show themselves as fiery, patriotic, and doing more for their country than the other occupants of the coach: the nuns claim to be travelling to a military hospital to treat wounded French soldiers, thus offering the deciding argument towards persuading Boule de Suif to abandon her resistance. The narrator offers to excuse their crafty argumentation as accidental stupidity, but the nuns\\' base behavior as they fail to share food with the courtesan raises a question mark if not necessarily on their story then on their altruistic motivation. Cornudet is repeatedly shown as a man who is little more than a drunken, lecherous, and cowardly man who is not prepared to stand up for his vicious anti-German beliefs when the time comes. In contrast to all of these is Boule de Suif herself, revealed to be the most fiercely patriotic, kind-hearted, and morally admirable character, which Maupassant contrasts with the hypocrisy and snobbery of the other travellers. Despite being shunned by the other occupants at first, she gladly shares her picnic basket with the hungry occupants of the coach, but at the end of the novel, when she has no food for the other half of the journey, the coach\\'s other occupants refuse to share their food with her, an ingratitude made even worse by the fact that it was Boule de Suif\\'s personal sacrifice that allowed them to leave. Her self-sacrifice in sleeping with the German officer underlines her personal courage and the blind hypocrisy of the other travellers; the travellers go to great lengths to persuade Boule de Suif to sleep with the officer in order that he will let the coach continue its journey, and the travellers fill Boule de Suif\\'s head with arguments, arguing that it is for the good of the country, that it is not morally wrong to sleep with the officer in order to let the travellers leave, and that the longer she waits, the more young French soldiers will die as the nuns are not there to look after them. When Boule de Suif gives in and sleeps with the officer, the rest of the travellers throw a party without her, and when the coach finally leaves the next morning, they treat her with utter disgust and contempt despite the fact that she has freed them, and that it was they who induced her to lose her dignity.

The plot has often been adapted, in whole or in part, for films and other media:', \"HMCS Endeavour was an Endeavour-class\\xa0oceanographic research ship. The vessel served the Royal Canadian Navy and later the Canadian Forces from 1965 to 1999. Endeavour performed research in oceanography and anti-submarine warfare, primarily on the West Coast of Canada.   Endeavour had a displacement of 1,560 long tons (1,585\\xa0t) at full load with a length overall of 236\\xa0feet 0\\xa0inches (71.9\\xa0m), a beam of 38\\xa0feet 6\\xa0inches (11.7\\xa0m) and a draught of 13\\xa0feet 0\\xa0inches (4.0\\xa0m). Endeavour's hull was stiffened for work in areas with ice.[1] The ship was propelled by two shafts driven by a diesel-electric engine creating 2,960 shaft horsepower (2,207\\xa0kW). The machinery space was insulated to reduce noise. This gave the vessel a maximum speed of 16 knots (30\\xa0km/h) and a range of 10,000 nautical miles (19,000\\xa0km) at 12 knots (22\\xa0km/h). Endeavour could turn 2\\u200a1⁄2 times its length. The ship had a 48-by-31-foot (14.6\\xa0m ×\\xa09.4\\xa0m) helicopter deck. The ship was fitted with two 9-ton Austin-Weston telescopic cranes. Two oceanographical winches, each holding 5,000 fathoms (9,100\\xa0m) of wire, two bathythermograph winches and one deep-sea coring winch were also fitted. The vessel had a complement of 50, which included 10 officers, 13 scientists and two aircrew.[1] Endeavour was ordered from Yarrows Ltd. and constructed at their shipyard in Esquimalt, British Columbia and given the yard number 250.[2][3] Endeavour's keel was laid down on 4 September 1963 and the ship was launched on 4 September 1964.[3] The vessel was commissioned into the Royal Canadian Navy on 9 March 1965 and given the hull number AGOR 171.[1] Endeavour was deployed on the West Coast of Canada researching anti-submarine warfare from the time the ship entered service until 1999. The vessel replaced the old Bangor-class minesweeper Oshawa. In 1999, Endeavour was transferred to the East Coast to replace Quest temporarily, while Quest was undergoing modernisation. In 2000, Endeavour was discarded.[2]\", \"The beatus Landulf of Yariglia (Italian: Beato Landolfo da Vareglate[1]) was Benedictine Bishop of Asti, Italy.[2] He was born in the latter part of the eleventh century at ‘Vareglate’, which has been identified with the village of Vergiate to the north of Milan, and also with Variglié, a locality near Asti. He studied at the Benedictine monastery of San Pietro in Ciel d'Oro in Pavia, but did not become a monk.[3] Having been ordained a priest his career took him to Milan where, in 1100, he joined Anselm IV, Archbishop of Milan for the Crusade of 1101.

Unstable angina is considered to be present in patients with ischemic symptoms suggestive of an ACS and no elevation in troponin, with or without ECG changes indicative of ischemia (e.g., ST segment depression or transient elevation or new T wave inversion). Since an elevation in troponin may not be detectable for up to 12 hours after presentation, UA and NSTEMI are frequently indistinguishable at initial evaluation.   Unstable angina is angina pectoris caused by disruption of an atherosclerotic plaque with partial thrombosis and possibly embolization or vasospasm.[6][7] Unstable angina is characterized by at least one of the following: Fifty percent of people with unstable angina will have evidence of necrosis of the heart's muscular cells based on elevated cardiac serum markers such as creatine kinase isoenzyme (CK)-MB and troponin T or I, and thus have a diagnosis of non-ST elevation myocardial infarction.[9][10] Nitroglycerin can be used immediately to widen the coronary arteries and help increase blood flow to the heart.[citation needed] In addition, nitroglycerin causes peripheral venous and artery dilation reducing cardiac preload and afterload. These reductions allow for decreased stress on the heart and therefore lower the oxygen demand of the heart's muscle cells.[11] Antiplatelet drugs such as aspirin and clopidogrel can help reduce the progression of atherosclerotic plaque formation, as well as combining these with an anticoagulant such as a low molecular weight heparin.\", \"Gilson Lavis (/ˈɡɪlsən ˈleɪvɪs/ GHIL-sən LAY-viss, born David Leslie Gilson Lavis, 27 June 1951, Bedford, England) is an English drummer and portrait artist.

Oliver (March 30, 1984 – September 24, 2013) was an American football safety of the National Football League who was selected in the fourth round of the 2007 Supplemental NFL Draft by the San Diego Chargers. He was also briefly a member of the New Orleans Saints.   Oliver was heavily recruited as a Parade High School All-American for the Harrison High School Hoyas.[1] He was also ranked as the #1 cornerback by Rivals.com in 2003, and at 185 pounds timed unofficially with a 4.32 second 40-yard dash and a 37-inch vertical jump.[2] Oliver decided to stay close to home and committed to playing college football at the University of Georgia. After redshirting for a year, Oliver developed into a key reserve in his first two years playing, earning him preseason third-team All-SEC honors before his 3rd year. Oliver, thrust into a starting role broke out as one of the best corners in the SEC his junior year.[3] In his first game as a starter, filling in for the injured DeMario Minter, Oliver shut down University of Florida star Chad Jackson, holding him to only 2 catches for 22 yards. Oliver was awarded with Georgia\\'s Most Improved Defensive Player Award after the 2005 season.[4] Oliver had his best game as a Bulldog on November 25, 2006, against Georgia Tech shutting down the 2nd overall pick in the 2007 NFL Draft, Calvin Johnson, though not without some help from Georgia Tech quarterback Reggie Ball. Oliver, whose primary role was to contain Johnson, ended up frustrating the All-American by holding him to only 13 yards and 2 receptions, batting away 3 balls intended for Johnson and intercepting another. Reggie Ball threw the pass into heavy traffic on the Yellow Jackets final drive and Oliver came up with the interception sealing a 15-12 Bulldog victory.[5] Oliver finished the day with 4 solo tackles, 3 of which were on third down plays in the red zone, and also forced a fumble.[4] Oliver ended his three-season career at Georgia with 7 interceptions, 8 deflected passes, 94 tackles (74 solo), 8.5 tackles for loss, 3 sacks, 5 forced fumbles, and 2 recovered fumbles. Oliver was ruled academically ineligible on May 17, 2007 and decided to apply for the 2007 supplemental draft held 2 months later on July 12, 2007. Oliver, who tested well in the Wonderlic Test, was seen as a player who lacked the motivation to succeed in school rather than not having the aptitude or intelligence.[6] Despite not having as much time to train as other prospects who go through the normal draft process, Oliver was able to garner enough interest to be the consensus #1 player in the supplemental draft. The San Diego Chargers ended up bidding their 2008 4th rounder for the rights to select Oliver making him the 1st of only two players selected in 2007\\'s supplemental draft. The other player was Maryland tackle Jared Gaither selected by the Baltimore Ravens one round after Oliver.[7] In a statement concerning Oliver, Chargers General Manager, A. J. Smith said, \"We had the opportunity to get a good football player today, and we took it. Paul Oliver is a very competitive, aggressive, confident player. He\\'s not cautious about anything he does on the field. You know how we like depth. We\\'ll add Paul to the mix as a Charger and time will tell.\"[8] Despite timing poorly at his 2007 Pro Day, Oliver displayed good footwork and also did well in cornerback drills.[9] Oliver played for the Chargers from 2007 to 2010. He then became a free agent and signed with the Saints, but was released after being injured during training camp. On September 21, 2011, Oliver returned to the Chargers for the 2011 season.[11] Oliver committed suicide by self-inflicted gunshot on September 24, 2013.[12] He is survived by his wife, the former Chelsea Young, and two children.[13] Police on the incident state that Oliver shot himself in front of his wife and his two young boys.[14] It was later determined through analysis of Oliver\\'s brain that he suffered from an advanced form of Chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, caused by repeated concussions he endured during his football playing career.[15]', 'Annisis is a monotypic genus of deep-sea bamboo coral of the Isididae family.[1]', 'A standstill agreement was an agreement signed between the newly independent dominions of India and Pakistan and the princely states of the British Indian Empire prior to their integration in the new dominions. The form of the agreement was bilateral between a dominion and a princely state. It provided that all the administrative arrangements then existing between the British Crown and the state would continue unaltered between the signatory dominion (India or Pakistan) and the princely state, until new arrangements were made.[1]   The draft of the Standstill agreement was formulated on 3 June 1947 by the Political department of the British Indian government. The agreement provided that all the administrative arrangements of \\'common concern\\' then existing between the British Crown and any particular signatory state would continue unaltered between the signatory dominion (India or Pakistan) and the state until new arrangements were made. A separate schedule specified the matters of common concern. During discussion, Jawaharlal Nehru, the future Prime Minister of India, doubted if the agreement should cover only \\'administrative\\' matters. Mohammad Ali Jinnah, the future Governor General of Pakistan, gave his view that it should be so.[2] The standstill agreement was separate from the Instrument of Accession, formulated by the States Department around the same time, which was a legal document that involved a surrender of sovereignty to the extent specified in the Instrument.[1] Both the draft agreements were presented to the Chamber of Princes on 25 July. A States Negotiating Committee was formed to discuss both the agreements, consisting of ten rulers and twelve ministers. After discussion, the Committee finalised both the draft agreements on 31 July.[3] Some native rulers of the princely states attempted to buy time by stating that they would sign the Standstill agreement but not the Instrument of Accession until they had time to decide. In response, the Indian government took the position that it would sign standstill agreements with only those states that acceded.[4] By 15 August 1947, the appointed deadline and the day of Indian independence, all but four princely states interior to India, some 560 of them, signed both the Instrument of Accession and Standstill agreement with India. The exceptions were Hyderabad, a large state in the centre of South India that received an extension for a period of two months, and three small states in Gujarat: Junagadh and its subsidiaries (Mangrol and Babariawad).[5] The state of Junagadh executed Instrument of Accession as well as Standstill agreement with Pakistan on 15 August. It was accepted by Pakistan on 13 September.[5] Junagadh was the only state that declared accession to Pakistan by 15 August.[6] The state of Jammu and Kashmir, which was contiguous to both India and Pakistan, decided to remain independent. It offered to sign standstill agreements with both of the dominions. Pakistan immediately accepted, but India asked for further discussions. The Khanate of Kalat, at the western periphery of Pakistan, also decided to remain independent. It signed a standstill agreement with Pakistan. Pakistan signed a standstill agreement with the ruler of the state of Jammu and Kashmir. India did not sign this instrument. The Nizam of Hyderabad, who had previously received a three-month extension to agree new arrangements with the Dominion of Inida, wrote to the Government of India on 18 September that he was willing to make a treaty of association with India. But he maintained that an accession would lead to disturbance and bloodshed in the state.[7] On 11 October, Hyderabad sent a delegation to Delhi with a draft Standstill agreement, which was characterised as \"elaborate\" by V. P. Menon, the secretary of the States Department. The States minister Vallabhbhai Patel rejected any agreement that would not completely cede Defence and External affairs to the Government of India. Upon the advice of Governor General Louis Mountbatten, Menon prepared a new draft agreement which was sent back with the Hyderabad delegation. The Executive Council of the Nizam discussed the agreement and approved it with six votes to three. Nizam expressed acceptance but delayed signing the agreement.[8] Soon the Nizam came under pressure from Majlis-e-Ittehadul Muslimeen (Ittehad), the Muslim nationalist party that was active in the state, and backed off from the agreement.[8] On the morning of 27 October, Qasim Rizvi, the leader of Ittehad, organised a massive demonstration of several thousand activists to blockade the delegation\\'s departure. He persuaded the Nizam that, since India was then tied up with defending Kashmir, it had insufficient resources to pressure Hyderabad. He claimed that an agreement considerably more favourable to Hyderabad was possible.[9] The Nizam then appointed a new delegation dominated by the Executive Council members that opposed the previous agreement.[10] Former Hyderabad bureaucrat Mohammed Hyder called this event the \"October Coup\". From this point on, Qasim Rizvi began to call the shots in the Hyderabad administration.[11] The new delegation secured only trivial amendments to the earlier draft of the agreement.[12] It laid down that all agreements and administrative arrangements then existing between the British Crown and the Nizam would continue with the Government of India. These included defence, external affairs and communications (the three subjects normally covered in the Instrument of Accession). Agents would be exchanged between Hyderabad and India. The Government of India agreed to renounce the functions of paramountcy. The Standstill agreement was to remain in force for a period of one year.[13] The agreement was signed by the Nizam on 29 November 1947.[14] Significantly, the agreement did not provide for the Dominion of India to station Indian forces in the state, whereas British India had maintained various cantonments, particularly in Secunderabad, as part of its \"subsidiary alliance\" with state. Over the course of the next 6 months, the Indian troops were withdrawn from the state.[15] According to K. M. Munshi, who was appointed as India\\'s Agent General in Hyderabad, Indians felt that entering into a Standstill agreement with Hyderabad meant that India had lost its grip on Hyderabad affairs. The Hyderabad State Congress opposed it because it was seen as a sign of weakness by the government of India.[16] V. P. Menon has stated that Nizam and his advisers viewed the agreement as providing breathing space during which the Indian troops would be withdrawn and the state could build up its position so as to assert independence.[17] Hyderabad violated all clauses of the agreement: in external affairs, by carrying out intrigues with Pakistan, to which it secretly loaned 15 million pounds; in defence, by building up a large semi-private army; in communications, by interfering with the traffic at the borders and the through traffic of Indian railways.[18] India was also accused of violating the agreement by imposing an economic blockade. It turned out that the state of Bombay was interfering with supplies to Hyderabad without the knowledge of Delhi. The Government promised to take up the matter with the provincial governments, but scholar Lucien Benichou states that it was never done. India also delayed arms shipments to Hyderabad from India, which is considered a breach of the standstill agreement.[19] More seriously, the Ittehad promoted vast armed bands of razakars who threatened communal peace inside the state as well as along the border. After multiple rounds of negotiations, the government of India delivered an ultimatum on 31 August 1948, demanding a ban on the razakars and the stationing of Indian troops in the state to keep law and order. When these were denied, India invaded the state on 13 September sending in troops via three access routes. The Nizam surrendered after four days, and agreed to Indian demands.[20] Subsequently, he signed the Instrument of Accession in November 1948.[21]', 'Marble Rock is a rock outcrop at the edge of the ice cliff about 0.8 nautical miles (1.5\\xa0km) west-southwest of West Arm and Mawson Station, on the coast of Mac.

He did his schooling in Bangalore Corporation School. He was once a successful autorickshaw driver. Ravi Varma began his journey with Sandalwood in 1995 as fight assistant. A big breakthrough in his movie career happened when he assumed the role of action director in the Kannada flick Dharma in 2004, in which the principal trouper was Darshan. His biggest Sandalwood movie so far is Darshan\\'s Sangoli Rayanna, an epic period movie filmed on a grand scale with 1000 artists. Ravi Varma entered Telugu industry with Krishna Vamsi’s Mahatma in 2009. In quick time Ravi Varma’s breath taking stunts in South film industry started making news in Bollywood and earned him a break with Prabhu Deva’s R... Rajkumar in which Shahid Kapoor played the lead role. He also worked with superstars of bollywood such as Salman Khan, Shah Rukh Khan and Ajay Devgan in the films Jai Ho,[1] Raees, Action Jackson respectively. He has become one of the most sought-after stunt directors in Bollywood and South Indian film industry, with many biggies in his kitty in 2016. His prime projects are Doddmane Hudga, Jaguar, Santhu Straight Forward, Dhruva, Rock On!! 2 and Machine. Ravi Varma has also expressed his plans of venturing into movie direction soon.[2] His directorial debut in the yet-to-be-titled project, will have for the first time ever Rajkumar brothers Shiva Rajkumar and Puneeth Rajkumar coming together for a movie.[3] Ravi Varma has bagged many awards from the Kannada and the Telugu film industries.[4] He is conferred with the title Saahasa Saarvabouma,[5] by the Kannada film industry. He has been conferred with honorary doctorate from \"Academy of Universal Global Peace University, Chennai.\"[6] He became the first technician in the film industry to get a doctorate award. 1. http://bangaloremirror.indiatimes.com/bangalore/others/nothing-short-of-murder/articleshow/55300665.cms 2. http://www.ibtimes.co.in/masti-gudi-tragedy-ravi-verma-deep-trouble-allegedly-ignored-safety-measures-after-taking-money-703376 3. http://bangaloremirror.indiatimes.com/bangalore/others/Heat-is-on-Stunt-director/articleshow/55341107.cms 4. http://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/actors-killed-horror-accident-leaping-9215124 5. http://newsable.asianetnews.tv/south/masti-gudi-tragedy-duniya-vijay-nagashekhar-ravi-varma-face-ban 6. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ydW3nDjiVfQ', \"The Toronto Varsity Blues football team represents the University of Toronto in the sport of Canadian football. The program won the first Grey Cup game ever held in 1909, and went on to win the cup again in 1910, 1911, and 1920. After intercollegiate teams no longer competed for the Grey Cup, the team won the first Vanier Cup ever held in 1965, and then again in 1993 as Canadian national football champions. The team has 25 Yates Cup championship wins as champions of the Ontario University Athletics conference of the CIS, a total second only to the 29 won by the Western Ontario Mustangs. However, hard times have fallen on the University of Toronto football team in recent years. The football program had not won a game since the 2001 season (a win that itself ended an 18-game losing streak).[1] On October 13, 2007, they set the record for the longest losing streak in Canadian university history, at 49 losses in a row. This losing streak was snapped on September 1, 2008 when they defeated the Waterloo Warriors 18-17 for their first win in almost seven years.[2] The team last posted a winning record in 1995.[3] The team was led by head coach Greg DeLaval who won his first game with the Blues when the team ended their record-setting losing streak in 2008. In 2010, the Blues posted a remarkable 40-35 win over the second-ranked Ottawa Gee-Gees, which was their first win over a nationally ranked opponent since 1997 against the Waterloo Warriors.[4] The Blues finished with a 3-5 record in 2010, which was their best since the 1996 season when they posted the same mark. The Blues hired Greg Gary as head coach in 2011, and finished with another 3-5 record, once again finishing just out of the playoffs in seventh place. The team took a step back with a 2-6 record in 2012, including home losses to fellow 2-6 teams York and Ottawa. However, in 2013, they finished the season 4-4, the first time since 1993, but failed to make the playoffs.[5] The team again regressed in 2014 with a 2-6 record, but rebounded in 2015 with a slightly improved 3-5 record. The program again failed to gain any momentum and won only two games the following season.   The following is the record of the Toronto Varsity Blues football team since 2003: [6] As of the start of the 2016 CFL season, six former Varsity Blues players are on CFL teams' rosters:\", \"Tom White was an American football official in the United States Football League from 1983-1986 and then National Football League (NFL) for seventeen seasons from the 1989 to 2005 seasons.[1] He started in the league as a head linesman and was promoted to referee with the start of the 1990 NFL season. He wore uniform number 123. He is also an alumnus of the Sigma Tau Gamma fraternity. White was once referred to as Alfred Hitchcock for facial similarities by former ABC Sports color commentator Dennis Miller during a Monday Night Football game.[2] White was fined half a game check ($2,600) by the NFL for an administrative error made by his officiating crew in a 2003 regular season game between the Baltimore Ravens and Seattle Seahawks. They refused to restart the 40-second clock after an officials' conference over a penalty call with 58 seconds left in the fourth quarter. Baltimore was able to save its last timeout as a result, using the 40 seconds to tie the game. Baltimore eventually won in overtime, by the score of 44 to 41.[3]\", \"The Christian Church in French Polynesia was formed in 1958 when a single parish left the Maói Protestant Church. It was motivated by a political issue, this church supported the independence from France, while the Maói Protestant Church was against. There's no theological differences between these churches. In 2004 there were 8 congregations and 1,000 members.[1] \", 'Autonomous car liability (or liability of driverless cars,[1] self-driving cars,[2] or robotic cars[3]) is a developing area of law and policy that will determine who is liable when an autonomous car causes harm to persons or property.[4] As autonomous cars shift the responsibility of driving from humans to autonomous car technology, there is a need for existing liability laws to evolve in order to fairly identify the appropriate remedies for damage and injury.[5] Increases in the use of autonomous car technologies (e.g. advanced driver-assistance systems) is not only causing incremental shifts in this responsibility of driving but also reducing the frequency of on the road accidents.[6] As higher levels of autonomy are commercially introduced (level 3&4), the insurance industry stands to see greater proportions of commercial and product liability lines, while personal automobile insurance shrinks.[7]   Existing tort liability for drivers and insurers and product liability for manufacturer provide the current basis for governing crashes. There are three basic theories of tort liability: traditional negligence, no-fault liability and strict liability.[5] According to a National Motor Vehicle Crash Causation Survey, over 90% of the crashes (representing an estimated 2 million crashes nationwide) involved the driver as the critical reason of the crash.[8] Meanwhile, research from the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS) shows that Advanced Driver-Assistance Systems, which are seen as stepping stones to get to Level 3 and 4 autonomy, have helped reduce accidents by employing forward collision warnings and automatic braking.[9] Given these trends, increased use of autonomous vehicle technology could reduce the number of accidents and prevent crash-related deaths.[10] Consequently, it is likely that cases of traditional negligence will fall and this will in turn reduce automobile-insurance costs.[5] With the onset of fully autonomous cars, it is possible that the need for specialized automobile insurance disappears and that health insurance and homeowner’s liability insurance instead cover automobile crashes, much in the same way that it covers bicycle accidents.[5] Moreover, as cases of traditional negligence decrease, no-fault insurance systems appear attractive given its benefits.[5] It would provide compensation to victims relatively quickly and the compensation would not depend on the identification of a party at-fault. In such systems, individual drivers would be well protected and would encourage the adoption of autonomous cars for its safety and cost-related benefits. Product liability governs the liability of manufacturers in terms of negligence and strict liability.[5] In such cases, autonomous car manufacturers are compelled to reduce the danger of their products as much as they can within a reasonable cost structure. Yet, strict liability covers an expansive range of potential harms that manufacturers may find difficult to protect against. Manufacturers may then find themselves incentivized to pass on potential costs of liability to consumers through higher prices. Furthermore, product liability cases distinguish among various types of defects. Under manufacturing defects, a plaintiff needs to show that the autonomous car failed to work as specified by the manufacturer. In the case of autonomous cars, however, this presents a major hurdle because no court has applied manufacturing defects to software, which is not something tangible that is manufactured.[11] If a crash stems from a software error, then the traditional product liability law on manufacturing defects may not suffice. A greater understanding of how software will be treated under this liability law, particularly when a software error causes physical parts to malfunction, needs to be explored. Historically, courts have used two tests for defectiveness of design: consumer-expectations and cost-benefit. Consumer-expectations: \"A product is defective in design or formulation when it is more dangerous than an ordinary consumer would expect when used in an intended or reasonably foreseeable manner. Moreover, the question of what an ordinary consumer expects in terms of the risks posed by the product is generally one for the trier of fact.\"[12] Given the broad nature of what consumers may expect out of autonomous cars, the consumer-expectation may result in substantial liability for manufacturers. On the other hand, the cost-benefit test weighs the benefits against the costs of a product in determining whether a design is defective. With autonomous cars, the plaintiff could make the argument that a different design, whether in the physical features of the vehicle or in the software that controls the movements of the vehicle, could have made the vehicle safer.[13] For plaintiffs, this creates a high burden of proof and also makes it difficult to find qualified experts.[11] In asking \"who do I sue,\" a plaintiff in a traditional car crash would assign blame to the driver or the car manufacturer, depending on the cause of the crash. In a crash involving an autonomous car, a plaintiff may have four options to pursue.[11] 1) Operator of the vehicle: in Florida and Nevada, an operator is defined as a person who causes the autonomous technology to engage, regardless of whether the person is physically in the vehicle.[14] California, on the other hand, specifies that an operator as “the person who is seated in the driver’s seat, or, if there is no person in the driver’s seat, causes the autonomous technology to engage.”[11] The viability of a claim against the operator will determine on the level of autonomy. For instance, if the autonomous technology allows the passenger to cede full control to the vehicle, then the passenger will likely not be found to be at fault for a crash caused by the technology.[11] 2) Car manufacturer: with this option, a plaintiff will need to determine whether the manufacturer had a part in installing autonomous technology into the vehicle. States such as Florida, however, are providing protection by limiting product liability for manufacturers.[14] 3) Company that created the finished autonomous car: Volvo is an example of a manufacturer who has pledged to take full responsibility for accidents caused by its self-driving technology.[15] 4) Company that created the autonomous car technology: Companies under this option could include those developing the software behind the autonomous car and those manufacturing the sensor systems that allow a vehicle to detect its surrounding. In defense of such liabilities, autonomous vehicle manufacturers could make the argument of comparative negligence, product misuse and state of the art.[5] With comparative negligence, the driver or passenger interference is seen as a part of the cause of harm and injury. With product misuse, the driver or passenger may be at fault for disregarding directions or altering the vehicle in a way to affect the proper performance of the vehicle. With state of the art, manufacturers could make the argument that there were not safe alternative designs at the time of manufacturing.[5] As cars become more interconnected and autonomous, the potential for hacking a car system to acquire data and cause harm poses a serious risk. For manufacturers and developers of autonomous technology, liability exposures arise from the collection and storage of data and personal information in the vehicle and in the cloud.[16] Currently, manufacturers require indemnification from vendors and subcontractors (dealerships, repair/installation facilities, etc.) and this practice will likely be extended to autonomous technology developers. As argued in the article “The Coming Collision Between Autonomous Vehicles and the Liability System” by Gary Marchant and Rachel Lindor, it is impossible for a manufacturer to anticipate all possible scenarios that an autonomous car will encounter.[17] While the manufacturer will design the system to minimize risks of situations that it does anticipate, the accidents that are most damaging and costly will be those that the manufacturer fails to anticipate. This leaves the manufacturer highly vulnerable to design defects, in particular the cost-benefit test. In light of this, Marchant and Lindor argues that “the technology is potentially doomed...because the liability burden on the manufacturer may be prohibitive of further development. Thus, even though an autonomous vehicle may be safer overall than a conventional vehicle, it will shift the responsibility for accidents, and hence liability, from drivers to manufacturers. The shift will push the manufacturer away from the socially-optimal outcome—to develop the autonomous vehicle.”[17] Consequently, policymakers need to be mindful of manufacturer overbearing the liability costs and the potential consequences that may result, such as higher consumer costs and delays in introducing autonomous car technology. In the report “Autonomous Vehicle Technology” by the Rand Corporation, the authors recommend that policymakers consider approaches such as tort preemption, a federal insurance backstop and long-term cost-benefit analysis of the legal standard for reasonableness.[5] These approaches attempt to align the private and public costs of the autonomous car technology such that adoption is not unnecessarily delayed and one party does not overly-bear the costs. Defining a clear role for the federal government as it relates to autonomous cars has been difficult but research groups have suggested potential options. In a report titled \"Products Liability and Driverless Cars: Issues and Guiding Principles for Legislation,\" the Brookings Institution argues that the federal government should establish a nationally consistent set of safety regulations.[18] The standards set at the federal level would provide state courts metrics and viewpoints that they can adopt in liability cases. Given the strong incentives for manufacturers to provide safe autonomous technology, the report further makes the point that a lack of specific minimum safety standards should not be a reason to put the autonomous car industry on hold. Moreover, the report argues that congressional preemption of state tort remedies with respect to autonomous vehicle liability should not be undertaken. State courts have historically applied state tort remedies and that should be the case going forward with autonomous cars. While state court remedies may sometimes be inconsistent, the federal government should not put itself in the position of trying to formulate and impose a certain set of liability standards on the states.[18] On September 2016, the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration released a policy report to accelerate the adoption of autonomous car technology (or HAVs, highly automated vehicles) and provide guidelines for an initial regulatory framework. Summary of key points is provided below:[19] • States are responsible for determining liability rules for HAVs. States should consider how to allocate liability among HAV owners, operators, passengers, manufacturers, and others when a crash occurs. • Determination of who or what is the “driver” of an HAV in a given circumstance does not necessarily determine liability for crashes involving that HAV. • Rules and laws allocating tort liability could have a significant effect on both consumer acceptance of HAVs and their rate of deployment. Such rules also could have a substantial effect on the level and incidence of automobile liability insurance costs in jurisdictions in which HAVs operate. • In the future, the States may identify additional liability issues and seek to develop consistent solutions. It may be desirable to create a commission to study liability and insurance issues and make recommendations to the States. According to the NHTSA, states retain their responsibility for motor vehicle insurance and liability regimes, among other traditional responsibilities such as vehicle licensing and registration and traffic laws and enforcement.[14] Several states, such as Michigan and Nevada, and Washington D.C. have explicitly written provisions for how liability will be treated. In a white paper titled “Marketplace of Change: Automobile Insurance in the Era of Autonomous Vehicles,” KPMG estimated that personal auto accounted for 87% of loss insurance, while commercial auto accounted for 13% in 2013.[7] By 2040, personal auto is projected to fall to 58%, while commercial auto rises to 28% and products liability gains 14%. This reflects the view that personal liability will fall as the responsibility of driving shifts to the vehicle and that mobility on demand will take greater hold. In addition, with the view that the overall pie representing losses covered by liability policies will shrink as autonomous cars cause fewer accidents. [7] Although KPMG cautions that this elimination of excess capacity will bring about significant changes to the insurance industry, 32% of insurance firm leaders expect that driverless vehicles will have no material impact on the insurance industry over the next 10 years.[7] Inaction by the large players has opened up opportunities for new entrants. For example, Metromile, an insurance provider start-up founded in 2011, has started to offer usage-based insurance for low-mileage drivers and designed a policy to complement the commercial coverage of Uber drivers.[20] In 2015, Volvo issued a press release claiming that Volvo would accept full liability whenever its cars in autonomous mode.[15] President and Chief Executive of Volvo Cars Håkan Samuelsson went further urging \"regulators to work closely with car makers to solve controversial outstanding issues such as questions over legal liability in the event that a self-driving car is involved in a crash or hacked by a criminal third party.\"[15] In an IEEE article, the senior technical leader for safety and driver support technologies at Volvo echoed a similar sentiment saying, “if we made a mistake in designing the brakes or writing the software, it is not reasonable to put the liability on the customer...we say to the customer, you can spend time on something else, we take responsibility.”[21]', 'The Desprez Opening is a chess opening characterized by the opening move: The opening is named after the French player Marcel Desprez. Like a number of other rare openings, 1.h4 has some alternate names such as Kadas Opening (after Gabor Kadas, a Hungarian player), Anti-Borg Opening, Samurai Opening, and Reagan\\'s Attack (according to Eric Schiller\\'s Unorthodox Chess Openings, the latter is a political gibe against Ronald Reagan, since 1. h4 is \"thoroughly unmotivated and creates weaknesses with only vague promises of future potential\"). As the Desprez Opening is very rare, it is considered an irregular opening, so it is classified under the A00 code in the Encyclopaedia of Chess Openings.  Like 1.a4, the Ware Opening, 1.h4 is an irrelevant pawn move which does nothing in the fight over central space, and does very little for development. The only piece released is the rook, and this piece is usually not developed by moving it to h3. In addition, 1.h4 weakens White\\'s kingside. For all of these reasons, 1.h4 is among the rarest of the twenty possible first moves for White. Black usually responds by grabbing the center with 1...d5 or 1...e5, and simple and sound development by 1...Nf6 is also possible. However, 1...g6, intending to fianchetto Black\\'s bishop on g7, is rare because White can undermine Black\\'s pawn structure with 2.h5, making 1.h4 seem like a logical move. Grandmaster David Bronstein once remarked that he knew of a Russian player who always opened 1.h4 and always won. His point was that after 1. ...e5 2.g3 d5 3.d4! exd4 4.Qxd4 Nc6 5.Qd1 Nf6 6.Nh3! Be7 7.Nf4 0-0 8.Bg2 the f4 knight is well placed and White has a good position.[1] However, Black does not have to be so cooperative.

Using the positions determined in their pools, the nine teams faced off to determine their placing in the 2004 Fed Cup Europe/Africa Zone Group II. The top two teams advanced to Group I for next year, and the bottom two teams were relegated down to the Europe/Africa Zone Group III.   The first and second placed teams of each pool were placed against each other in two head-to-head rounds. The winner of the rounds advanced to Group I.

It was written by Allen George and Fred McFarlane and originally released in 1990 by Champion Records in the United Kingdom. In 1992, it was remixed by Swedish house music production duo StoneBridge and Nick Nice, and re-released in many European countries as well as United States and Japan. It became one of the most well known house anthems in the United Kingdom, and Robin\\'s biggest hit to date. It helped to make house more mainstream and the song is often confused with her following single \"Luv 4 Luv\", which is compositionally similar and was released around the same time, and with the 1997 hit \"Show Me Love\" by the Swedish singer Robyn. In the US, \"Show Me Love\" reached number five on the Billboard Hot 100, number seven on the R&B chart,[3] and number one on the dance club chart. It was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America and sold 600,000 copies domestically.[4][5] Additionally, the song went to number six on the UK Singles Chart in April 1993.[6] \"Show Me Love\" has since been sampled and interpolated in numerous recordings, including \"Don\\'t Wanna Go Home\" by Jason Derulo (2011) and \"Show Me\" by Kid Ink   \"Show Me Love\" was written by American songwriters Allen George and Fred McFarland, who had previously worked with Jenny Burton and Jocelyn Brown. The song was initially released in 1990 on British label Champion Records with remixes by Anthony King. The singer, New York-born Robin Stonewall was a mother of two, working as a secretary for the mayor in Hempstead.[7] In the weekends she used to sing in an R&B-band. She was offered to record this song, and then the song was released in France and Germany, but it flopped. Two years later, in 1992, Swedish DJ and producer StoneBridge remixed the song on suggestion of British record company Champion.[8][9] Stonebridge was in London and accidentally heard one of his remixes in a club. Excited by this he asked Champion if they had more songs he could remix. They told him that they had an old song called \"Show Me Love\" and sent it to Stonebridge. He remixed it, but Champion wasn\\'t satisfied with the new result. Frustrated by this Stonebridge decided to change the remix again, adding an intro and several components. The result was the 1992-version of \"Show Me Love\".[7] The song\\'s iconic bass organ sound comes from the Korg M1 synthesizer;[10][11] the organ patch used was simply the one immediately above the “Pick Bass” used in the original mix. It took him four hours to make it and StoneBridge had no clue what he had on his hands with the remix. A few days later he listened to it again and thought it was \"pretty bad, but my girlfriend convinced me to send it off, and the rest was history.\"[12] Stonebridge was paid 1 000 £ for the remix. In the 2011 essay compilation \\'The Remix Manual: The Art and Science of Dance Music Remixing with Logic\\' by Simon Langford, StoneBridge recalls this process: \"They said they had this failed project with a great vocal. I got the tape and did three or four mixes that they didn\\'t like at all. In frustration, I decided to go in and do one final mix. I stripped the track to just the kick drum and vocal, changed the bass sound I had used for the latest mix and it happened to be an organ...I then found a snare drum from a record, but it had a kick in it, so it got this heavy attack that worked perfectly with the massive kick. I then put on two string chords in the chorus and put a little distorted stab thing in the intro and it was done in a little bit over four hours.\"[12] At this time, Robin S. gave birth to her third child and didn\\'t care much about \"that song\". She was told that a young guy in Sweden had made a new version of the song. After hearing the new version she liked it and changed her artistname from \\'Robin Stone\\' to \\'Robin S.\\'. 500 12\" singles without covers were made, which slowly was spread from DJ to DJ all around the world. Soon the song started to climb on the charts and when it reached 6th place on the charts in the UK, Robin S. made her first TV-appearance in British music chart television programme Top of the Pops.[7] The remixed version was later included on Robin S.\\'s 1993 debut album Show Me Love. A music video was made which sees Robin S. performing in a club. It was directed by Millicent Shelton. The song made it to the top five on the Billboard Hot 100 in the United States, a rare feat for a house song at the time. According to The Guardian, \"Show Me Love\" has influenced contemporary house songs such as Kiesza\\'s \"Hideaway\" (2014) and Disclosure\\'s \"White Noise\" (2013), and artists such as Clean Bandit and Felix Jaehn.[11] Mixmag ranked it #93 in The 100 Best Dance Singles of All Time in 1996.[1] DJ Magazine ranked it number 40 in their list of Top 100 Club Tunes in 1998.[13] VH1 placed \"Show Me Love\" at #73 in their list of 100 Greatest Dance Songs [2] Slant Magazine ranked the song 41st in its 100 Greatest Dance Songs-list in 2006, adding: \"“Show Me Love” was not just one of the biggest house-pop crossovers of the early-\\'90s club-radio boom, it was also one of the last. At least radio house went out with its face on (that is, before it came back in its more Euro varieties). 1993\\'s “Show Me Love” was as representative as any track of the way house distilled disco\\'s flamboyant, strings-and-all yearning into a minimal thump with skeletal keyboards doing the bulk of melodic support (as defined by Swedish producer Stonebridge\\'s remix).\"[14] Slant Magazine also ranked the song #80 in its The 100 Best Singles of the 1990s-list in 2011.[15] The Guardian featured the song on their A history of modern music: Dance in 2011.[16] MTV Dance placed \"Show Me Love\" at #43 in their list of The 100 Biggest 90\\'s Dance Anthems Of All Time in November 2011.[17] Mixmag ranked it #34 in 50 Greatest Dance Tracks Of All Time in 2013 [3] Heart TV ranked the song number 1 in their list of 55 Biggest 90\\'s Club Classics in March 2017.[18] In 2007, Mobin Master Had the very first successful cover version of the song, with beatport #2 for over 8 consecutive weeks and an ARIA (Australian record industry nomination). https://itunes.apple.com/au/album/show-me-love-feat-karina-chavez/id292512464  In 2008, German DJ and producer Michael Mind recorded a cover version of the song using a different vocalist. In 2008, following the successful sample of the Mobin Master cover mashup with another song called \"Be\" by Steve Angello and Laidback Luke, Swedish DJ and producer Steve Angello and Filipino-Dutch DJ Laidback Luke used the parts to reconstruct their mashup. Robin S. is featured re-recording her vocals, engineered and co-produced by Mobin Master, which was initially recorded for his version. Also featured are additional vocals from Hal Ritson (co-producer) and Yolanda Quartey.[43] It was originally released through the Happy Music label on December 12,[44] and has had multiple re-releases since. \"Show Me Love\" is one of Angello\\'s and Luke\\'s best known singles, especially in the United Kingdom where it has topped the UK Dance Chart in 2009. The song was also an international breakthrough for Dutch DJ Hardwell.[45] The song is based on his illegal bootleg mashup of Mobin Master\\'s cover of \"Show Me Love\", with vocalist Karina Chavez and the instrumental track \"Be\" by Steve Angello & Laidback Luke.[46] In 2015, the song was remade by Sam Feldt featuring vocals from Kimberly Anne. It was released as a digital download on 21 June 2015 in the United Kingdom through Spinnin\\' Records. The song was produced by Sam Feldt. *sales figures based on certification alone\\n^shipments figures based on certification alone\\nsales+streaming figures based on certification alone']\n"
